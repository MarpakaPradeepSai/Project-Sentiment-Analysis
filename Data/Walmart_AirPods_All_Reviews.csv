Review of Apple AirPods with Charging Case,donniehoover_9188,4,2024-12-20,"Okay, imagine this: You're listening to your favorite song, and suddenly, BAM! No wires, no tangles, and you feel like a secret agent. That's what Apple AirPods are like! These little white earbuds sit in your ears, play music, and even let you talk to people like magic. The Good Stuff: Easy-Peasy to Use: Open the case, and poof they connect to your iPad, iPhone, or Mac like they're best friends. No buttons, no fiddling. Portable and Cute: The little case is like a tiny house for the AirPods. It's small enough to fit in your pocket and even charges the AirPods while they nap. Sound is Pretty Cool: Music sounds clear, and you can even hear all the words when people talk to you on the phone. Super Smart: Take one out of your ear, and the music pauses like it knows what you're thinking. The Not-So-Great Stuff: Easy to Lose: They're small and white, like little marshmallows, so don't drop them in the couch! Pricey: These are not cheap, like buying a lot of candy at once. No Noise Blocker: If your little brother is yelling, you'll still hear him because these don't block all the noise. Who Are They For? If you love techy things, cool gadgets, and want music without wires, AirPods are a lot of fun. But if you're always losing stuff or want to save your allowance, maybe think about it. In a nutshell: AirPods are like a fun toy for your ears, but you have to take good care of them and save up your pennies."
Love Love Love,shelbyn82_6812,5,2024-12-20,"I have used the Apple brand Airpods for a couple of years, and they are hands down the best on the market. I have tried other brands of wireless headphones, but, non compare to these. The comfort, ease of use, price, and quality are top notch."

Amazing little music machines!,Shanna,4,2024-12-18,"These are great for people who have smaller ear canals and can't wear the ones with the rubber tips. The sound quality is amazing. I really liked the setup, super simple and easy!"
Great until they weren't,cierraw14_6346,4,2024-12-18,"The sound quality is amazing. It truly is noise cancelling and stays connected when you are pretty far from your device, which I love for the gym. They stay in my ears and are comfortable for the most part, except when worn for long periods of time they start to irritate my ears because they are so hard. Overtime the battery life has definitely faded. After three years of owning them I've also repeatedly had my AirPods give out when they are fully charged. One ear will randomly stop playing music which defeats the whole purpose of noise cancelling headphones. My AirPods are refurbished but I've seen others who have had this same issue. I would be pretty upset if I paid full price for this to eventually happen, but because they give out so frequently I have stopped using them all together."

Happy with my purchase,Lilu,5,2024-12-11,"Was looking to replace old ones since they were 5 years old and mic didnt work. Found out that Wallmart have a deal. Been using it for awhile, so far no trouble, also they are authentic"
"Why won't they stay in my ears?! Is it me, or you",kaaaayp_3174,4,2024-12-11,"I love my AirPods. But no matter what I do I can't wear them long term. And sometimes when I run they want to fly out.

Don't waste your money,Jen,1,2024-12-10,Junk. They were junk when I bought them 4 years ago and again 2 years ago and now. Returned them. They don't hold a charge at all (lasted 1 hour and that was without watching anything. Just in my ear!) and the case went from 100% charged to 48% charge when charging 1 of the AirPods.

Their lightweight, comfortable design makes them perfect for extended use, while the sound quality is rich and balanced for music, calls, and podcasts. Features like active noise cancellation (on Pro models) and transparency mode enhance the listening experience. The built-in microphone ensures clear voice quality, and the compact charging case provides excellent portability and long battery life.

,Brittany,1,2024-12-09,"I was not at all pleased with my purchase of these after having a AirPod Pro second generation set which I was over the moon about however I had lost this pair. I purchased this pair through Walmart and was extremely unhappy with every possible thing they had to offer from the noise canceling to the pairing with my Apple iPhone, even down to them fitting in my ears so of course I returned them immediately to Walmart I never bother with the return process of taking them to my nearest post office or even having them picked up from my home because every time I've tried having them picked up at my home. It takes forever for them to be credited back to my account or even the option of taking them to the post office. It takes forever as well for them to be credited to my account however, when I return them at Walmart, it's literally that day or if not the next that it goes on my account that the credit is shown, which is amazing for me!!! Because there is no other retailer anywhere when I return an item at the store that this is done with my bank and for this I give Walmart five stars"

BEWARE IF YOU DO NOT PURCHASE WALMART WARRANTY,ARLENE,5,2024-12-09,I've owned 12 apple air pods in the last five years and never insured any of them. They all only lasted a minimum of 2 years so hopefully with the Walmart warranty I could at least use the ones I just purchased for at least 3 years.

Convenient and Sleek,salcedosauce_8700,5,2024-12-08,"The Apple AirPods were revolutionary as an earbud for being easy to use, wireless, and hosting decent sound quality. The wireless connection is effortless, quickly turning on as you put the earbuds on, and there are many useful functionalities of the AirPod that anyone can appreciate such as configuring the touch sensors on each earbud, and pausing playback when taking the AirPods off. The case is compact and minimal, it makes accessing these AirPods easier in a bag rather than rummaging through wired earphones. I mainly use these earbuds as a backup to my over the ear headphones, when I need something smaller, especially for the gym. I find that they don't fall out of my ear but that can be subjective to other users."

Apple AirPods are a fantastic option for anyone in,lidiab69_7160,5,2024-12-08,"The AirPods feature a sleek, minimalist design that fits comfortably in the ear. They're lightweight and come with a compact charging case that makes them easy to carry around. The sound quality is impressive, offering clear highs, balanced mids, and decent bass response. They are suitable for a variety of music genres and deliver an immersive audio experience. With up to 5 hours of listening time on a single charge and an additional 24 hours with the charging case, the battery life is excellent for everyday use. The integration with Apple devices is seamless, thanks to the W1 (or H1) chip. Pairing is quick, and they automatically switch between devices that are linked to the same iCloud account. AirPods come with touch controls for playback and Siri integration, allowing users to control their music and calls easily."
"The best headphones for comfort, ease, and focus!",alwaysmari_2682,5,2024-12-08,"I have never ONCE regretted buying my Airpods. They are the best headphones I have every tried. As someone who hates regular over-the-ear headphones because they give me headaches, Airpods have been a game changer. I'll admit, I was a little late to the game, but it was worth it because the ease of connectivity to my devices, and the comfort of wearing them! 10/10 recommend."
"simple, reliable, but limited",naomia140_3704,4,2024-12-08,"Air pods set the standard for wireless earbuds when they launched, offering seamless integration with apple devices, reliable connectivity and solid audio quality. The design is lightweight and comfortable for extended use. Though it may not be secure in all ear shapes. Audio performance is decent, with balances sound and clear vocals, but lacks the depth and bass that audiophiles might desire. The key advantage lies in their ease of use. The pairing process is almost instantaneous, and features like automatic pause when removed from your ear enhance the overall experience. Unfortunately they do lack water resistance and noise cancelation, making them less ideal for workouts or noisy environments. Despite these limitations, the air pods remain a solid choice for apple users who p;roiratizeconvenicen and simplicity over advanced features."

Poor quality,MS,1,2024-12-06,They don't work well and considering they're brand new the first couple uses should have been better than my old ones that are several years old. I found these ones bro be worse and they don't pick up my voice in phone calls well at all. Very echoey and distant for the other person on the line

Not bad for price,Brandon,3,2024-12-06,Theyre okay for the black friday price. Strongly prefer the airpods pro 2. Worth the extra money and hearing aid capability.

Great Sound,jackelineg16_9387,5,2024-12-06,"I'm not going to be redundant on all the media reviews, but I love the sound of these. Yes, they are a little difficult to get out of the case, but only a tiny bit. They are very usable. I like the different sound options. They stay in my ears, no problem even when walking fast. And the cost doesn't break the bank. Overall, excellent purchase !"

Well experience,,5,2024-12-06,I received airpod in low time and great thanks to the walmart.
,shirley,5,2024-12-06,everyone has them now
They make them inconsistently now...,ReesesCup20,3,2024-12-06,"I've gone through more pairs of things than I want to admit. From losing an entire case with them inside to losing 1 Airpod while volunteering to then losing the other Airpod while out and about and then randomly being able to pair 2 Airpods from different sets together to form a new pair... I should just give it up by now. LOL I keep buying them because I really like the convenience of Airpods without paying the price of the newer ones and of course, no cords attached. The BASS and evenness of all the sounds in different songs is really why I enjoy using Airpods. It makes for a good listening experience. HOWEVER-- my last 2 pair were extremely questionable. The 1st set was extremely bass-heavy to the point where even pop songs or light rock music didn't sound like the actual song does. It was pretty annoying listening to such a heavy sound in every single song. My very last pair are opposite almost. The treble is extremely high, certain instruments sound screechy and voices are so much louder than the music. On some parts in the song, a certain sound will jump out that I've never heard before in the song but if I hear it elsewhere, that same sound is more muted and blends in better. These newest pair are awful. I don't know what the heck is going on with the last few batches of these things I've gotten, but it's just not good. With this last pair here, I think I've gotten my sign to try something new out finally. Knowing me, I'll be spending good money with whoever I go with considering my ability to lose or destroy them time after time. sigh.. lol"

Apple AirPods (1st Gen) Review: Still Worth It in,kaitlynnrennee_2999,4,2024-12-04,"The first-generation Apple AirPods were revolutionary when they debuted, and while they've been surpassed by newer models, they still hold up surprisingly well for casual users. Design The sleek, minimalistic design is lightweight and comfortable. They sit snugly in my ears during everyday use, but they may not be secure enough for intense workouts. The charging case is compact, making it easy to carry, though its finish does show wear over time. Sound Quality The sound quality is good for casual listening, with decent clarity and balance. However, there's no noise-cancellation, so they're not ideal for noisy environments. Audiophiles may find the bass a little lacking compared to newer models. Ease of Use The seamless pairing with Apple devices remains one of their strongest features. Simply open the case, and they connect instantly. Switching between devices is straightforward as long as you're within the Apple ecosystem. Battery Life Battery life is where their age starts to show. On a full charge, you get about 5 hours of listening time, but over time, the battery performance can degrade significantly. The case provides additional charges, but it doesn't support wireless charging like newer versions. Verdict The 1st Gen AirPods are a solid choice if you're looking for basic wireless earbuds and can find them at a discounted price. For anyone who prioritizes features like noise-cancellation or longer battery life, it's worth considering the newer models or alternatives."

Worth it. Best generation AirPod.,Angela,5,2024-12-03,"Best generation in my opinion. The pros caused my husbands ears to react from the intensity of the sound proof design. His ear literally leaked clear fluid every time he used them. This generation is better, no reactions. Also they fit perfectly. He has large ears and I have small ears but we both can wear these all day no problem. They never fall out and the sound quality is great. Worth every penny. Don't buy the off brands.

Useful and convenient,,5,2024-12-03,"I've been using Apple AirPods for a few months, and they're a great option for wireless earbuds, especially for Apple users. The seamless connectivity across devices is outstanding, making pairing and switching effortless. The sound quality is crisp and clear, perfect for casual listening and calls, and the lightweight design ensures comfort even during extended use. Battery life is solid, with around 5 hours per charge and additional power from the charging case. Features like ‚ÄúHey Siri‚Äù and automatic ear detection add convenience, though the fit may not suit everyone, as the standard model lacks customizable ear tips. Additionally, noise isolation is minimal, so they're less ideal in loud environments. Despite these minor drawbacks, they deliver a premium experience overall."
As expected,Kaz,5,2024-12-03,As expected
Tech upgrade,certifiedtired_5166,5,2024-12-03,"I recently replace my old earbuds with the Apple AirPods and I can't believe I waited so long to get these. These are a serious upgrade from the ones I had been using. The sound quality is great, the sound is so clear. Once they charge, they last for several hours during the day and I typically used them for an 8+ hour work shift. I have a habit of taking an earbud out and leaving it somewhere around the house and I love that it has the capability of showing where the earbuds are and playing a sound to help me find it in the house."

It lasts for days and even when I wear them throughout the entire school day they stay connected, comfortable, and the sound is always going to be great.

There so easy to charge and they charge so fast! I love the way that you can't get so many different cute cases for your AirPods and decorate it how you like it. It's also not expensive and pretty affordable. It's also so easy to get and it's not bad quality !"
AIR PODS WORKED GREAT!,adamj85_2373,5,2024-11-30,"I was honestly expecting some scratches at least. The only thing was the box which just had some leftover stick from tape. The sound quality was great and they are a great fit for me. 10/10 recommend.People saying that they got earwax in there stuff were probably lying or just got the worst choice, I got these today and they had no earwax, no gunk, the only thing wrong was a little bit or wear on the box but that's it, not even scratches on the case, came with charger too, fits good and comfy, good sound quality but not as good as headphones ofc. Charges lowkey fast. You would not be able to tell these AirPods were refurbished. They look brand new and the sound quality is excellent. They charge pretty quickly and it does come with the charging cord you need. If you're like me and wanted a pair of AirPods but don't necessarily need the newest generation (and want to save some money), then this is a great value."

I spoke on the phone with people using these AirPods and he didn't care at all that I was on the phone! they are clear when you speak through them, sound great, awesome battery, life, comfortable in your ears, connect to my iPhone, perfectly, and are very durable! I have used these on road trips and vacations and during workouts! They never fall out of my ears!"
Long lasting AirPods,melsunn_318586,4,2024-11-25,"Have had these AirPods for over 3 years now and they have a long battery life, are comfortable and easy to carry around. The only downside is that the right earbud was somehow damaged and now I can't use Siri or answer phone calls while having them on. After all the newer models have came out I still love my old ones because they get the job done"
,cheryl,5,2024-11-25,They are awesome and my grandkids love them.
A must have!,jastelker_18523,5,2024-11-25,"Apple AirPods with the charging case are an absolute game-changer! The sound quality is amazing, delivering crisp, clear audio with great bass and balanced tones. They stay charged for a long time, making them perfect for extended use throughout the day without constantly needing to recharge. I also love how easy it is to find cute cases to personalize and protect them. These are so easy to connect to all of my Apple devices and are comfortable to wear. Overall, they're stylish, functional, and a joy to use. Highly recommend!"

Not a bad guy for the money,Wayne,5,2024-11-25,Great ear buds comes with a convenient rechargeable case. I wish they were a bit stickier and not quite so slick they seem to fall out of my ear quite easily. Good sounds but I wish they had more base.

Great for the price point,isacca1_122790,5,2024-11-25,Apple keeps changing AirPods every year. So older models won't have the same features. i would just buy some and upgrade two years later.

AirPods are an amazing product,adrianw40_748867,4,2024-11-25,"From noise canceling to Siri commands. The AirPods are ABSALUTLY an amazing item to own, whether you're jamming to music, or wanting a calm time for relaxing, AirPods are the perfect headphones for everything!"
Great Everyday Earbuds with a Minor Fit Issue,swampwitchsupreme_193753,5,2024-11-25,"The Apple AirPods offer excellent convenience and sound quality for their time. They're lightweight, easy to pair with Apple devices, and have reliable battery life, especially with the charging case. The automatic pause/play feature when removing an earbud is a nice touch, and the compact design makes them easy to carry anywhere. The only downside is the fit. While they work fine for casual use, they can fall out during vigorous activity. Using silicone wings or ear hooks can solve this problem, but it creates a new one: the charging case won't close properly with the wings attached. This means you have to remove and reattach them each time, which is inconvenient. Overall, these are great for everyday use if you're in the Apple ecosystem and don't mind the minor annoyance of fit accessories. For intense workouts, you might consider alternatives or the newer generations, which improve on the fit and features."
Best air pod !!,clairee95_592534,5,2024-11-25,"recently got the latest AirPods, and I'm genuinely impressed. The sound quality is excellent, with clear highs and rich bass, making music and calls an enjoyable experience. The noise-cancellation feature is outstanding, effectively blocking out background noise, whether I'm in a noisy caf√© or on public transport. The fit is comfortable and secure, even during workouts, and the battery life has noticeably improved, lasting me a full day with moderate use. The new touch controls are intuitive and make switching tracks or adjusting volume super easy. However, they're still on the pricey side, and while the design is sleek, it's not drastically different from previous models. Overall, the new AirPods are a fantastic upgrade for Apple users, offering top-notch performance and convenience. Highly recommended if you're looking for premium wireless earbuds."

Perfect wireless alternative to the original apple,rianas11_356731,5,2024-11-23,"I love my AirPods and use them almost daily. They charge super quickly in the case, and the case stays charged for a really long time. Sound quality is also good but I'm not an expert by any means. I'm someone that hates noise cancelling headphones (hate the feeling like I'm under water) and how the pros fit inside the ear, so the fact that these fit like the original Apple headphones is perfect for me and don't have noise cancelling abilities. However, if you are okay with noise cancelling then the sound quality may not be as good to you."

Double-tap to skip tracks? Yes, please. Music automatically pausing when you take an AirPod out? Mind-blown ü§Ø. And don't even get me started on how cool it feels to be part of the AirPods squad ‚Äì it's like a secret club for the tech-savvy. ## The Social Factor Let's be real for a sec ‚Äì AirPods are more than just earbuds. They're a whole vibe, a status symbol that says, ""Yeah, I've got my life together (sort of)"". When you're rocking these, you're not just listening to music; you're making a statement. ## Final Thoughts Sure, they're a bit of an investment, but trust me, they're worth every penny. The convenience, the quality, the cool factor ‚Äì it all adds up to an experience that'll change the way you listen to music and interact with your devices. So, if you're looking to up your audio game and join the wireless revolution, Apple AirPods are the way to go. They're not just earbuds; they're a lifestyle upgrade. Get ready to turn heads and enjoy your music like never before! üé∂üëÇ‚ú® Sources"

not comfortable  on the ear,kamiliae_247835,1,2024-11-23,I have the the first and second generation of AirPods and I feel they fit better in the ear and they don't fall down as much This one I feel they will easily fell and get lost and I was right bc I had them but I came back to the 1 &2 generation And maybe not everyone will agree but it's my point of view of comfort and walking without worrying that u might lose ur headphones.

AirPods over time,leahm453_27717,3,2024-11-23,I have had my AirPods for 5 years and their battery life has stayed amazing! Unfortunately the sound quality and volume has decreased significantly.

üéß Apple AirPods: The Perfect Everyday Companion,ninaa160_49979,5,2024-11-22,"My AirPods come with me everywhere‚Äîthey've become like an extension of me at this point! Their compact design and lightweight build make them incredibly convenient. Whether I'm walking, multitasking on calls, or dressing up, they fit seamlessly into my lifestyle. They slip into any bag, don't get tangled in my hair, and are perfect for traveling without taking up space. Convenience: They make multitasking a breeze, especially for hands-free calls. Portability: Small enough to fit in even my tiniest bags. Sleek Design: They stay out of the way no matter what I'm wearing. Sound Quality: The AirPods deliver impressive audio performance.

Good for a short while,chrimosa_388981,3,2024-11-22,"I have gone through 3 separate sets of AirPods and after a year they tend to just die, or just one Airpod will no longer connect.

Poor sound, and in spite of multiple sized covers, they wouldn't stay in place. These sound great, and they stay in my ears! I don't care that they're not the latest version.

Ear the world's better,sandiac2_192816,5,2024-11-22,"Apple's AirPods lineup continues to impress, offering a range of models that cater to different needs. The AirPods Pro 2 are perfect for those who seek excellent sound quality, superb Active Noise Cancellation (ANC), and seamless integration with Apple devices. They also feature innovative hearing health functions, including a built-in hearing test and hearing aid features. For those looking for over-ear comfort, the AirPods Max provide premium sound, good ANC, and long battery life, although they are quite expensive. On the more affordable end, the AirPods 4 offer solid sound and features like Adaptive EQ and Voice Isolation but lack ANC, making them ideal for those seeking good quality at a lower price.

Why buy 3rd gen?,Aaron,5,2024-11-18,"AirPods are new and came in Apple packaging. They work great and respond to ""Hey Siri"" (if you're phone is setup for it of course). While reviews of AirPods say the third gen has better sound quality, I think you'd have to be an audiophile testing them back-to-back to tell the difference; as such, these are excellent quality and cost under $100!"

Love Apple Airpods,kluteshab,5,2024-11-13,"The Apple AirPods with Charging Case are a fantastic choice for anyone looking for seamless, high-quality wireless earbuds. Their quick and easy setup with Apple devices makes pairing a breeze, and once connected, they automatically sync across all your devices, allowing for effortless switching. With rich, clear audio quality, the AirPods provide a superb listening experience for music, podcasts, and calls. They're designed for comfort, fitting securely in the ear, so they're great for everyday use, whether you're working, exercising, or commuting. The included charging case is compact and portable, allowing you to recharge on the go. A single charge offers up to 5 hours of listening time, and the case provides multiple additional charges, extending battery life to over 24 hours. Overall, the Apple AirPods with Charging Case deliver a premium listening experience with high-quality sound, long-lasting battery life, and convenient portability. They're an ideal choice for anyone seeking dependable, high-performance wireless earbuds."
The AirPods Charging Case is a great addition that,christopherl40,5,2024-11-13,"The AirPods Charging Case is a compact and essential accessory for AirPods users, offering a convenient way to keep the earbuds charged on the go. Here's a breakdown of its key features and performance: Design & Build The case has a sleek, minimalistic design that aligns perfectly with Apple's aesthetic, and it's small enough to fit easily in pockets, bags, or purses. Its glossy white finish looks modern but is prone to scuffs and scratches over time, so you might want to consider a protective cover if durability is a concern. Charging Efficiency One of the case's strengths is its efficiency. When fully charged, the case can offer multiple full recharges for the AirPods, extending listening time significantly. The wireless version of the case also supports Qi wireless charging, which is a nice touch for those who prefer a cable-free experience. Charging via the lightning port is still the primary option, and it's reliable and relatively quick. Battery Life & Performance The battery life of the charging case is impressive for its size. You can get up to 24 hours of listening time with multiple recharges, which makes it a lifesaver for long trips. In my experience, the case holds a charge for several days, even with regular AirPod use, before needing to be recharged itself. Convenience & Ease of Use The case is incredibly easy to use. Simply drop the AirPods in, and they magnetically snap into place, starting the charging process immediately. A small LED indicator provides a quick glance at the battery status‚Äîgreen for fully charged, amber for low, and it's a thoughtful addition that takes out the guesswork. Downsides One downside is that the charging case itself doesn't have the strongest build. Over time, the hinge can feel a bit looser, and as mentioned, the glossy surface is prone to visible wear. Additionally, the lack of USB-C charging (as of current models) may be inconvenient for those looking to streamline their device cables. Final Verdict . Rating: 5/5"

If you listen to a variety of audio content, you might find the Adaptive EQ feature helpful for balancing the sound profile to fit each type. 2. Noise Cancellation & Transparency Mode: The Active Noise Cancellation does a great job of muting background noise, making them perfect if you need focus or want to fully immerse yourself in music. The Transparency mode feels natural and is great when you need awareness of your surroundings, like during quick conversations or commutes. 3. Comfort & Fit: lightweight and comfortable for extended wear. The different ear tips allow for a customized fit, which helps them stay secure without causing any discomfort over time. 4. Battery Life: On a full charge, they typically last for several hours, with an easy boost from the charging case. If you're using noise cancellation frequently, you may need to charge them a bit sooner, but they're still reliable for daily use."
I love them! Easy to use and has lasted me years.,hannahp590,5,2024-11-12,"Perfect for on the go, relaxing, airplane. Perfect. They never fall out of my ears. They have also lasted years which is amazing."

Even better when they get delivered in an hour,Lakergirl,5,2024-11-12,Needed to replace a first generation unit as they stopped working for my daughter after a few years of use and the timing was needed immediately due to her catching a flight that afternoon.

Apple AirPods,officialdearmiranda,5,2024-11-12,These headphones are pretty great. Although I always feel like they will fall out of my ears they always stay put. I'm usually reading and listening to audiobooks so I expect them to be charged for awhile. They will last for about 6 hours hopefully and then will go out but I think it's pretty good bc usually after hour three I'm taking them out. Overall they are great.

Plus, they're so easy to carry around in the charging case. Overall, I'd say they're worth it if you're looking for wireless earbuds that just work."
The best headphones one can ever own!!!!,syedai8,5,2024-11-10,I've owned the first generation AirPods and the AirPods Pro 2 and I can tell you the AirPods 4 is the best I've ever owned hands down.

The Apple EarPods with charging case are a great c,beracahp,5,2024-11-10,"I recently picked up the Apple EarPods with the charging case, and they have proven to be a reliable and user-friendly choice for everyday listening. Design and Comfort: Apple's signature sleek design is evident in these EarPods. They fit comfortably in my ears without causing any discomfort, even after hours of use. But I would say not really for heavy active work outs, tends to fall at times. Sound Quality: The sound performance is impressive for standard EarPods. Ease of Use: Pairing the EarPods with my iPhone was seamless. Simply opening the charging case near my phone initiated an automatic connection."

"Great for everyday, comfortable and my everyday AirPods",dianaa626,5,2024-11-09,"It's been my first AirPods that I loved so much, I think I got them around 2018 and it's 2024 now and they still work, and I use them everyday. They comfortable and don't fall out of my ear. I would say the quality is good back at the time where I bought it. I didn't really complain about it. I am thinking right now to buy the AirPods 2 Pro I think since mine went through a lot. And, I used mine in water, which is not waterproof so don't risk it like me, but they still works just fine. I don't think noise canceling is great on this that's probably the only down side"

AirPods Pro - On the go,retrendtech,5,2024-11-06,"I recently started taking long walks to clear my head and get some extra exercise. I picked up these headphones to pair with my iPhone and it's been pretty awesome. The noise cancellation is a little freaky, but nice. I had to let a few people try it out to experience it for themselves. I also like the conversation awareness. If I start talking with someone, it lowers my music, so I can be in the moment and then raises back up when the conversation has ended. No need to take out a headphone!"

Def recommend these are perfect!,rickb20,5,2024-11-04,"The Apple AirPods case is a sleek, compact, and incredibly convenient accessory that perfectly complements the AirPods experience. From the moment you unbox it, you can tell that Apple has put thought into every detail of its design. The case itself is small enough to fit comfortably in a pocket or bag, which makes it ideal for those who are always on the go. Its glossy, minimalist finish is not only visually appealing but also easy to clean. The magnetic lid closure feels solid and reliable, giving a satisfying snap that ensures your AirPods are safe and secure inside. One of the standout features of the AirPods case is its wireless charging capability. This feature makes it incredibly easy to keep your AirPods powered up. I love that I can just place the case on a Qi-compatible charging pad without the need for cables, which has been a game-changer in terms of convenience. Additionally, the LED indicator light on the front provides quick feedback on the charging status, so you always know when your AirPods are ready to go. Even if you don't have a wireless charger, the Lightning port on the bottom allows for quick, easy charging with the included cable, making it versatile and accessible. In terms of durability, the AirPods case holds up well over time. I've had mine for several months, and despite daily use, it still looks as good as new. The case's strong hinge and magnetic closure ensure that it withstands regular opening and closing without showing signs of wear. The battery life of the case is impressive too‚Äîit can fully charge the AirPods multiple times before it needs to be recharged itself. Overall, the AirPods case is a well-designed, durable, and highly functional accessory that enhances the AirPods experience. Whether you're at home, at the office, or on the go, this case makes it easy to keep your AirPods protected and fully charged."

Love it,michellem1684,5,2024-11-03,"Apple AirPods Review: Worth Every Penny for the Ultimate Listening Experience When it comes to wireless earbuds, the Apple AirPods set the bar high, and after using them daily, it's easy to see why they have such a strong following. From their seamless integration with Apple devices to their impressive sound quality and sleek design, AirPods have genuinely transformed how I experience music, podcasts, and calls. Design and Comfort The first thing you notice about AirPods is their iconic design: minimal, stylish, and compact. The charging case is lightweight and easily fits into any pocket or bag, making it perfect for on-the-go use. Once in your ears, they are incredibly comfortable‚Äîeven for extended listening sessions. I was initially skeptical about how well they would fit, but the ergonomic shape surprised me by staying secure, even during workouts or long walks. Seamless Connectivity One of the standout features of AirPods is how effortlessly they connect to Apple devices. Opening the case near my iPhone automatically triggers the setup, and from there, it's instant pairing every time. They sync across all my Apple gadgets, from my iPad to my Apple Watch, making switching between devices a breeze. It's a level of convenience that has made other earbuds I've tried feel outdated. Sound Quality Now, onto the most important part: the sound. AirPods deliver clear, balanced audio with rich bass and crisp highs. Whether I'm listening to an upbeat playlist or a calming podcast, the sound quality is consistently impressive. The noise isolation isn't completely immersive like noise-canceling headphones, but they do an excellent job of minimizing outside distractions. For everyday use, the sound profile is perfect for everything from phone calls to streaming my favorite shows. Call Quality and Microphone Speaking of calls, the built-in microphones on the AirPods are top-notch. I often take work meetings and casual calls using them, and I've never had complaints about my voice sounding muffled or unclear. The microphones pick up my voice clearly, even in slightly noisy environments, which is a massive win for anyone who uses them for work. Battery Life and Charging Battery life is another area where AirPods shine. I can easily get 5 hours of listening time on a single charge, and the charging case provides multiple recharges, extending the total listening time to over 24 hours. Quick charge is a lifesaver; just 15 minutes in the case gives you around 3 hours of playback, which has saved me on many occasions when I forgot to charge them overnight. Limitations and Considerations While I love my AirPods, they're not without a few drawbacks. If you're an Android user, some features‚Äîlike automatic pausing and Siri integration‚Äîare limited. Additionally, if you're looking for more advanced noise cancellation, you might want to consider the AirPods Pro. Still, for casual and everyday use, the original AirPods deliver a premium experience that's hard to match. Overall Verdict Apple AirPods are a game-changer for anyone looking to upgrade their audio experience. The convenience, design, and sound quality make them a must-have for any Apple ecosystem user. While the price may be steep, the value they add to daily life makes it well worth the investment. If you're on the fence, take the plunge‚Äîyou won't regret it!"
Apple AirPods,vitoriaf22,5,2024-11-03,"The sound quality is incredible. I use it everyday at the gym, for homework, or when i just want to relax. It is really good because you can carry it everywhere, and you can also just connect it to Bluetooth. One thing that the annoys me a little is that something the AirPods slide from my ears, that always happens when I'm running on the treadmill."
,latoya,5,2024-11-03,They work great
"Comfortable sound, frustrating Find My",sweethomearizona,3,2024-11-03,"We recently got a pair of Apple AirPods for our family, and overall, we've had a pretty good experience. One of the standout features for us is comfort‚Äîunlike some newer brands, these don't hurt our ears after long use, which is a big plus for our family. However, we ran into a major issue with the Find My feature. Unfortunately, it didn't work as well as we hoped, and we ended up losing the AirPods twice, forcing us to replace them both times. This was frustrating, especially considering the price point. So while we enjoy wearing them and appreciate the comfort, the lost and replaced pairs have definitely affected our overall satisfaction. If the locating mechanism were more reliable, I think we'd be much happier with our purchase!"

"Apple's AirPods are known for their sleek design, seamless integration with Apple devices, and impressive sound quality",lizc269,5,2024-11-03,"Apple's AirPods are known for their sleek design, seamless integration with Apple devices, and impressive sound quality. AirPods are an excellent choice for Apple users. The Pro and Max models offer strong noise cancellation and advanced audio features like Spatial Audio, but the higher price points may be a factor for some buyers. They're best suited for users who prioritize convenience, quality, and the Apple experience."
Amazing Sound Quality!,khristianh,5,2024-11-03,"I bought these on a whim, thinking they would be like any other headphones, but I was wrong! The sound quality is excellent, they can be tracked, and they even have a water eject feature! Good job, Apple ü©∑ , you did great with this product."
Apple AirPods,vitoriaf22,5,2024-11-03,"The sound quality is incredible. I use it everyday at the gym, for homework, or when i just want to relax. It is really good because you can carry it everywhere, and you can also just connect it to Bluetooth. One thing that the annoys me a little is that something the AirPods slide from my ears, that always happens when I'm running on the treadmill."
Airpods,evelyns241,5,2024-11-03,"I liked how they were compact and easy to carry with me, they sounded great and stayed in my ears and didn't fall out once."

"If you want quality,and reliable earbuds,you have to get these!",julied428,5,2024-11-03,"Wow! These are the best ear buds ever! I have tried so many, but I am staying with these! The quality of the sound makes it great for running and wearing anywhere.I didn't have to charge these for over a week! That tells you battery life will last. So many other brands I had to charge every day."
Good!,alix2010,5,2024-11-03,"Comfortable, durable, easy fit into the ear. Battery life lasts a good while, several hours and can wait multiple days between charges. Sound quality is amazing."
Love it,michellem1684,5,2024-11-03,"Apple AirPods Review: Worth Every Penny for the Ultimate Listening Experience When it comes to wireless earbuds, the Apple AirPods set the bar high, and after using them daily, it's easy to see why they have such a strong following. From their seamless integration with Apple devices to their impressive sound quality and sleek design, AirPods have genuinely transformed how I experience music, podcasts, and calls. Design and Comfort The first thing you notice about AirPods is their iconic design: minimal, stylish, and compact. The charging case is lightweight and easily fits into any pocket or bag, making it perfect for on-the-go use. Once in your ears, they are incredibly comfortable‚Äîeven for extended listening sessions. I was initially skeptical about how well they would fit, but the ergonomic shape surprised me by staying secure, even during workouts or long walks. Seamless Connectivity One of the standout features of AirPods is how effortlessly they connect to Apple devices. Opening the case near my iPhone automatically triggers the setup, and from there, it's instant pairing every time. They sync across all my Apple gadgets, from my iPad to my Apple Watch, making switching between devices a breeze. It's a level of convenience that has made other earbuds I've tried feel outdated. Sound Quality Now, onto the most important part: the sound. AirPods deliver clear, balanced audio with rich bass and crisp highs. Whether I'm listening to an upbeat playlist or a calming podcast, the sound quality is consistently impressive. The noise isolation isn't completely immersive like noise-canceling headphones, but they do an excellent job of minimizing outside distractions. For everyday use, the sound profile is perfect for everything from phone calls to streaming my favorite shows. Call Quality and Microphone Speaking of calls, the built-in microphones on the AirPods are top-notch. I often take work meetings and casual calls using them, and I've never had complaints about my voice sounding muffled or unclear. The microphones pick up my voice clearly, even in slightly noisy environments, which is a massive win for anyone who uses them for work. Battery Life and Charging Battery life is another area where AirPods shine. I can easily get 5 hours of listening time on a single charge, and the charging case provides multiple recharges, extending the total listening time to over 24 hours. Quick charge is a lifesaver; just 15 minutes in the case gives you around 3 hours of playback, which has saved me on many occasions when I forgot to charge them overnight. Limitations and Considerations While I love my AirPods, they're not without a few drawbacks. If you're an Android user, some features‚Äîlike automatic pausing and Siri integration‚Äîare limited. Additionally, if you're looking for more advanced noise cancellation, you might want to consider the AirPods Pro. Still, for casual and everyday use, the original AirPods deliver a premium experience that's hard to match. Overall Verdict Apple AirPods are a game-changer for anyone looking to upgrade their audio experience. The convenience, design, and sound quality make them a must-have for any Apple ecosystem user. While the price may be steep, the value they add to daily life makes it well worth the investment. If you're on the fence, take the plunge‚Äîyou won't regret it!"

Order discontent,ashley,5,2024-11-01,"The airpods were exactly what i expected once received. The order and delivery process was terrible. I had to call customer service multiple times to even find out what was happening. Then we had to cancel the order and reorder. The return of fees took days to hit my account so I had ultimately paid twice. It was a nightmare. There is no reason why the store and the 800%23 people can't see the same information. This process should have just been a delayed delivery. Not a run around where I had to wait on a refund, reorder, repay, and wait on a later delivery."
Airpods,maggiew123,4,2024-11-01,They are great and the gps tracking if you lose a singular bud. Unfortunately they do not withstand being running over by a truck. But no fault to the product.

"The good, the bad & the ugly",cassandraaisha,4,2024-10-31,"Two things I ALWAYS need-AirPods & a computer. I keep my AirPods connected to my keys to be sure I don't leave home without them. They are a perfect fit (the pro's are too big imo). AirPods recharge rapidly & hold a charge for the entire day, or two, at times. They're not great at tuning out background noise for the person on the other end. If you have them in both ears, you can escape the world around you with a good book or music. They are difficult to keep clean no matter how hard you try. The small crevices collect things you can't wipe clean. But they stand the test of time by lasting for years. They have issues trying to connect when paired to more than one device. The biggest downside is the hinge on the case. It is flimsy (I've had this pair less than a year). I've missed many calls, texts & emails due to them falling open in my purse & connecting to my phone when I wasn't wearing them to hear notifications. If there were a way to lock them closed that would be a game changer. You also can't locate a lost pod, only the case. All in all these are my absolute favorite. They aren't without shortcomings, however, the quality & reliability in addition to the comfortable fit make them a staple for my functionality."
Be careful with the flap.,mollyt127,4,2024-10-31,"The case works quick to charge the overused earbuds, however, the flap gets loose easily. I've had to replace the case. The comfort of the earbuds is not great if you have piercings."
Parking spot for towing things,Louis,4,2024-10-31,Well you don't have a pull through parking spot so had to go inside to pick up my AirPods. Which was good
Great for all activities!,jennyl378,4,2024-10-31,"The fit of these are great! I never have to worry about them falling out, whether it's taking a call in the office or listening to music while I run. I've had them for 2 years now and the sound quality has never wavered-amazing! The only negative thing I have to say is as they age, like all tech, the battery life decreases. They used to stay charged for days but now, even if I don't use them, they die in a few days. Unfortunately, that's true for the case as well. It's their only flaw though which means, it's time for me to buy a new pair!"

Durable and comfortable,mychelley,4,2024-10-26,"This is still my go to after all these years. I can use this for up to a week everyday without charging it. To give reference, I use it roughly 2 hours 5 days a week when working. It's super comfortable which is a big plus bc my ears really don't like headphones. So to be able to use something that doesn't cover my out ears it's awesome. I would buy this again but haven't had to after roughly 3 years. It's nice to buy something that may be a little pricey work for longer than just a year."
No wires needed,antony1,4,2024-10-26,"The AirPods have a good sound, easy to carry with you and put the AirPods in case take anywhere with you. No wires the are getting in the way when working out.

Design and fit,davorv,4,2024-10-26,"First gen AirPods were really first no hassle earbuds that connected seamlessly without fuss with which they have made an experience so much greater than other bluetooth earbuds which from design standpoint were not as comfortable or as seamless at connecting with phone‚ÄîiPhone in particular. However, battery life was not ideal after a while as they depleted hour later, so as soon as you started listening long form podcasts your time was ticking to that dreaded sound of battery life ping going off soon into it."
Game changer,leerpaprelly,5,2024-10-26,Cordless is the future. I love talking on the phone without the wires over your body. This helps me multi task a lot of things. The sound quality is great and the battery life lasts so long. Great fit for my busy lifestyle!

Airpod Review Summary,kimkk54,4,2024-10-25,"For 1st and 2nd Gen, they were comfortable. I had used these for a while and the sound quality was always good if paired with an iPhone or android device. The fit was a little difficult depending on your ear shape because with some people it would stay and others it would fall out ever so often due to the fact that the tip was rigid and not flexible like the rubber/plastic tips on other earphones. They are durable but not waterproof. It is water resistant to an extent since you can run inside from the rain but cannot go swimming with them. Is would recommend it when it first launched and the upgraded ones only get better. Try it."

A Disappointing Experience with Apple AirPods,luckybella143,2,2024-10-25,"I was initially excited to purchase a pair of Apple AirPods due to their sleek design and seamless integration with my Apple devices. However, my experience was unfortunately short-lived. Within a few months of regular use, I began to notice issues with the AirPods. They started to charge intermittently and eventually stopped charging altogether. Despite trying various troubleshooting steps, I was unable to resolve the problem. While the AirPods were convenient and offered decent sound quality, their durability left much to be desired. Given the relatively high price point, I expected them to last longer than a few months. I would caution potential buyers to consider the potential for early malfunctions before investing in Apple AirPods. The fit is also terrible. They constantly fall out of the ear."

Proof photo shows someone else house. Called Walmart customer service after 48 hours from the ""delivery"". They were not helpful with the issue and asked me to wait another 48 hours. Address for the order has been confirmed to be correct. The delivery driver just dropped the package at random address. Walmart would not take responsibility claiming it is a third party delivery service. Very disappointing. When you call Amazon, they take care of you right on the spot. Walmart ecommerce is in the stone age. Buy elsewhere."

Great airpods!,vic_jade,5,2024-10-22,"To me these airpods are THE ones to get if you're wanting airpods. I've had mine for almost 3 years and they still work amazingly, even now when I no longer have an Iphone, I can still use them well with my new phone. They fit in my ear comfortably, but if i wear them for extended hours it can sometimes hurt a bit so I take ""headphone breaks"" if I'm needing them for work or studying."
Worth the price!,marke34,5,2024-10-22,"Review: Apple AirPods Apple's AirPods seamless integration with Apple devices makes them a top pick for any iPhone, iPad, or Mac user. The sound is crisp and clear, with a balanced bass that doesn't overpower the mids and highs. The noise-cancellation feature in the Pro model is a game-changer, effectively drowning out ambient noise for an immersive experience. The battery life is impressive. You get around five hours of listening time on a single charge, with the case providing an additional 24 hours. Plus, a quick 15-minute charge in the case gives you about three hours of listening time. Pairing is effortless, especially with the H1 chip enhancing performance. Switching between devices is smooth, and the Bluetooth range is substantial. They're on the pricey side, but for the convenience and quality, they're worth the investment.

Works good for basic users,neeha07,4,2024-10-22,"The Apple AirPods (1st generation) Truly Wireless are decent-sounding truly wireless earbuds with a sturdy and stylish design. They're compact, breathable and more stable than the Apple EarPods making them a suitable option for sports. However, getting a tight fit may vary from person to person. They also barely block any ambient noise, which helps you monitor your surroundings, but also means they will struggle in loud, noisy environments.It is comfortable enough for my ear but I dont think so it fits to everyone. The battery life is about 24 hrs if you use it often"

Bad Apple Ear Pods,Pam,1,2024-10-21,"These never worked. It was a total waste of time and money to purchase these ear pods from Walmart. They were not returnable because I waited too long to return them. I received them while I had company and didn't get to try them for a week or so, then I kept trying to charge them and thinking it was something I was doing wrong. When I finally realized they were defective too much time had passed and they were no longer returnable. So I am taking them to the Apple Store to see if they will take them. Walmart would not allow me to return them."

So I bought item at the store myself and 48 hours later, Walmart had provided no update on my refund and gave me a measly $10 credit as that can buy anything at your store where I refuse to ever shop again. So please give me my refund so I can move on a delete your worthless app and never shop at your business again."

The best wireless ear-phones,lilythekid,5,2024-10-17,"Apple Air pods are a great, if expensive priced wireless earphone for your I phone. They fit easily into your ear and are so comfortable you forget they are even there. The battery life is a good ten-twelve hours when they are fully charged. The wireless hands-free design is perfect for anyone who wants to listen to music while exercising or getting on with their busy daily life. They fit snug and never fall out. The sound quality is fantastic, nice and loud, and easily able to be changed by a little volume bottom on the side of the earphones. The ear phones seem pretty durable. I dropped them several times and they never appeared to suffer or show any signs of damage. They are on the pricey side (150 dollars) but for the quality, they are worth it. I highly recommend them. You won't find a better kind of ear-phone out there."

I rarely have to charge them whereas my old beats wireless headphones I had to charge every single day!

Awesome ear pieces,purnimam4,4,2024-10-17,I recommend it and I have gen one and gen 2 both. gen 2 is more useful as they have ear plug pieces to fit properly in the ear. gen 1 is great but sometime comes out itself.

Everyone needs one,heatherh645,5,2024-10-16,"The AirPods charging case is a game-changer for keeping my AirPods ready wherever I go. It's compact and fits perfectly in my pocket, making it easy to carry around.

The design is sleek and sturdy, and it's so convenient to just pop my AirPods back in for a quick charge. I never worry about running out of battery anymore‚Äîit's a must-have accessory!"

Their pop up screen on my phone lets me see their battery and you can also connect to your friends AirPods at the same time so you can listen to one phone on 2 different sets of AirPods via the audio share feature on Apple.

Worth the money you pay for the quality.,lola05,5,2024-10-15,"If you're looking for seamless connectivity, excellent sound quality, and convenience all packed into one, these are a must-have accessory. The sound quality is impeccable. Whether I'm listening to my favorite podcast, music, or editing videos, the audio is always crisp, clear, and balanced. They also handle calls pretty well - I've never had any complaints about my voice being muffled or hard to hear. The built-in microphones are great for clarity, even in noisier environments. The automatic connection when you put them in your ears feels great. Plus, the charging case means I can go longer without worrying about running out of battery. Just pop them in the case for a quick recharge! They fit comfortably in my ears. I like how they stay in place without any discomfort. The battery life is great too. A full charge gives me plenty of listening time."
Save the day,nicolem1532,4,2024-10-15,"Loved the long charge, even with regular use. I can listen to books and podcasts without being tethered to my phone. The best perk is how long they last while on long runs"

AirPod defect,William,3,2024-10-15,My left AirPod does not charge fully. When I took it back to them the serial numbers were different but they said because I got it through Affirm they could not exchange the product for me. Kind of disappointed is there anyway I can exchange for the same item?

Worth the money.,alinet26,5,2024-10-15,"I had the apple airpods when it first came out and have only switched to the airpods pro about 3 years ago when my husband gifted me the new pair. As far as comfort, I prefer the original airpods because I felt like they stayed in my ear much better than the airpod pros did. As far as sound, they both are amazing. My daughter prefers the airpod pros because she says the noise cancellation works so good (on her younger siblings). We both usually use one while letting the other charge and can last through the whole day like that with having to charge only once. The magnetic suction in the case helps to keep the airpods from falling out and running away."

Comfortable with a long battery life!,rileighs2,5,2024-10-14,My AirPods are the greatest thing to ever happen to me. They stay charged forever and I have had the same pair for years. The sound quality is always very impressive and the way it connects to my phone in seconds will always be a plus. They fit into my ears perfectly and I'll never own another pair of earbuds!
I love it,kellyh609,5,2024-10-14,The form factor of the case feels much like the original and is hard to distinguish between them. It was easy to pair to my airpods pros. And it charged at a similar speed to the original as well. I think that this is a good option for those that have lost or broken their original case. I would recommend this case.
Great product!,ashleys1825,5,2024-10-14,Great sound quality and the battery life is really good! Always use these outside walking or in the gym. Comfortable and very durable! They're an all around great product!

They connect seamlessly to all of my apple devices, and the case keeps them charged on the go! They are comfortable for all day use and stay in place during workouts! Would definitely recommend"
Somewhat okay‚Ä¶,momo_,4,2024-10-14,"I have been using this product since high school. I asked my dad to buy it for me because I needed it for my online classes. However, after using it for a while, I noticed that the battery doesn't last as long as Sony's. I find it annoying that I have to charge both the air pods and the case. The battery life during car rides is not as good as I expected, and I can't even listen to my music because it keeps dying every minute, which I hate. Despite that, it's good for short-term use if you don't want to use your headset or earbuds for a long time. The only good thing about it is that the sound is clear for some time, but it deteriorates when used for a long time."
Love my airpods,chelseas456,5,2024-10-14,I love the battery life my AirPods have and also the convenience of just using one headphone as I'm a mom. My only dislike is having to actually keep up with the one AirPod when I use it and then take it out but not by my case anymore.

NEVER AGAIN WILL I ORDER FROM WALMART FOR DELIVERY,Paula,1,2024-10-14,"This order was never received, I called the number to dispute and they said I would be refunded. Then I got an email and it read they would not be refunding the purchase price."
Received Counterfeits!,Brent,2,2024-10-14,"Wow, be careful ordering these. One of the airpods stopped working around the 30-day time period of returns. My daughter took it to the Apple Store for repairs and Apple could not verify the serial number. Apple's proposed resolution: ""Verified via VMI that AirPods are 3rd party and not Apple Original pods."" These were counterfeit. Not what I'd expect from WalMart. I called Walmart today and a refund request has been ""escalated."" The rep blamed Walmart's third-party seller. He also sent me a $15 off next $25 voucher. I'll update this review upon final resolution. I've attached the Apple Store's work authorization determining that the airpods were fake. If this happens to you, be sure to contact Walmart to report and receive a refund. I would've reviewed this with one star but Walmart appears to be trying to make it right."

Airpodz babeyyy,penceywrites,4,2024-10-13,"Great earbuds, I'm impressed with how far you can walk away from your device with them in. No skipping, static, or convection failure. The case and earbuds themselves can take a lot of damage. I took one star off because if you're like me and have sensitive ears (especially sensitive skin), they can cause ear canal irritation. They're also just painful in general if you wear them for too long. The mic quality isn't the best, either, it's very muffled. But besides that, they're great!"
Good sound,nealiniei,5,2024-10-13,"Good AirPods I've owned all versions of airpods, normal, pro, max, etc. My favorite one for the longest time was the Airpod Pros ""version 1"". This product is the Airpods Pro ""version 2"". It took me a while to convince myself to buy these, but after testing both side-by-side I noticed a few very noticeable features."

Great for quick listening and not super loud.,rysky,4,2024-10-13,Great for quick connections to apple devices with a sleek profile for throwing in a travel bag. For on-the-go the battery life is decent yet the fit could be better as it is not form fitting.
"Good battery life, good sound quality.",masterese,4,2024-10-13,"I had these for 4 years, they got the job done & the battery life is great. Mine however stopped connecting with calls and was only good for music.

Decent for the price,larad33,3,2024-10-13,"These are cool but I much prefer the AirPod Pro to these original ones. These hurt my ears after a little while. They're durable and battery life is decent but again, the AirPod pro is far superior. Sound quality is decent but could be a lot better.

Apple made 2nd gen worse,Ethan,1,2024-10-12,"I didn't like the 3rd gen because they didn't fit in my ears so I got another pair of the second gen a year or 2 ago (loved them, 1st and 2nd gen have great sound) but the batteries are bad now. So I just bought another pair of 2nd gen from Walmart and even though the model number is the same, they sound completely different. They're like cheap earphones.

Comfort and Fit,maryp437,5,2024-10-11,I love generation 1 air pods for the comfort and the fit. I've never have an issue with my battery life and I use them nonstop: I'm also super clumsy I've washed them several times and dropped them out of the case all the time so I'd say they are durable.

The most important thing about the AirPods 2nd gen,tinat247,5,2024-10-09,"The AirPods 2nd generation (also known as AirPods with Charging Case or Wireless Charging Case) were released by Apple in March 2019 as a follow-up to the original AirPods. Here's a breakdown of their key details: Design: ‚Ä¢ Form factor: The design of the 2nd-gen AirPods remains nearly identical to the original version, featuring an in-ear wireless design with stems. ‚Ä¢ Color: Available in the signature white finish. ‚Ä¢ Fit: One-size-fits-all design, though it's not customizable with different tip sizes like AirPods Pro. Key Features: ‚Ä¢ H1 Chip: The 2nd-gen AirPods are powered by Apple's H1 chip, which improves connection stability and efficiency. This chip also enables faster device switching and lowers latency for gaming and audio. ‚Ä¢ Performance improvements: Up to 50% more talk time, and up to 2x faster when switching between devices compared to the 1st-gen AirPods. ‚Ä¢ Low-latency: Reduced audio lag during gaming or when using AirPods for calls and media playback. ‚Ä¢ Hands-Free ‚ÄúHey Siri‚Äù: Unlike the 1st-gen AirPods, you don't need to tap to activate Siri. Just say ‚ÄúHey Siri‚Äù to make calls, adjust the volume, get directions, or control your music hands-free. ‚Ä¢ Wireless Charging Case (Optional): ‚Ä¢ The AirPods 2nd-gen offer two versions: one with the standard charging case and one with a wireless charging case. ‚Ä¢ Wireless Charging Case supports Qi wireless charging, allowing the case to be charged by simply placing it on a Qi-compatible charging mat. ‚Ä¢ The standard case charges via a Lightning connector. ‚Ä¢ Both cases hold additional charges for the AirPods, extending battery life when on the go. ‚Ä¢ Audio Sharing: The AirPods 2nd generation supports audio sharing with another set of Air"
Not my cup of tea,sonotemo,4,2024-10-09,"Man I hate these things. Let's start with the positives. The AirPods are light, they connect easily to any Apple device, the work with find my iPhone which is a huge plus and they are not overly expensive. Cons- they constantly fall out and which is why Apple made a NEW version in ‚Äò24 that's supposed to sit better in the ear. You always lost one side because it just kept falling out. My mom loves them and recently bought another pair(enclosed pictured) because she lost‚Ä¶. One side of her last pair. They always irritated my ear so I just paid the extra money and went to the pro."

How easy it is to take them anywhere,robynm120,5,2024-10-08,I love the ability to be able to take them anywhere. They fit in your pocket. The sound quality is really good and you may not think that because they are so small but it was a nice surprise. Its easy to forget they are in your ear because they are so comfortable.
Beautiful Airpods 2!!!,dianab581,5,2024-10-08,"I recently purchased the AirPods 2, and I couldn't be happier with my decision. The sound quality is impressive, with clear highs and deep bass that enhance my listening experience. The convenience of the automatic pairing with my Apple devices makes them incredibly user-friendly; I can seamlessly switch from my iPhone to my iPad without any hassle. The battery life is outstanding, providing up to 5 hours of listening time on a single charge, and the charging case gives me several additional charges, which is perfect for on-the-go use. I also appreciate the hands-free ""Hey Siri"" functionality, allowing me to control music and take calls without having to reach for my phone. Additionally, the design is sleek and lightweight, making them comfortable to wear for extended periods. Overall, the AirPods 2 have exceeded my expectations, and I highly recommend them to anyone looking for high-quality wireless earbuds. ---"
Bad experience,Priya,1,2024-10-08,Airpods are used and they sold it saying they are new
,Andy,2,2024-10-08,I cant even skip songs or turn up volume by tapping on the airpod. the sound is just like any other earbud ive owner and at least those give you skipping/volume options.

,WalmartCustomer,1,2024-10-07,The AirPods were delivered to the wrong address. Tried numerous times getting in contact with driver but to no avail. The picture they took of a house was down the street. When I approached them about the delivery they stated they didn't get anything. This is very dangerous go to someone else home to retrieve a wrong delivered item. You never know who is going to get upset at you accusing them. After reviewing the camera the driver never got out of the car.

"It's ok to have, but I use another one",nataliat142,5,2024-10-06,"One of the big advantages: you can switch music by double tapping the right earphone without taking out your phone, you can pick up and put down the phone, talk and even turn on Siri. The functionality is impressive. And now the first minus: a terrible shape, from which your ears hurt with prolonged use. When you use them once every couple of days, not for long, everything is ok. But when I take them on a trip and listen to music for 2-3 hours, the next day it is really impossible to insert the earphone into your ears, it hurts. The next minus of the shape: no noise insulation. I hear everything that is happening around, even when the music is loud. And people around me hear what I am listening to, even if the volume is average. The minus of the headphones: periodically they disintegrate and one or the other works, not amenable to either setup or reset or new pairing. Now about the case. Plastic, quite durable, the lid slams shut itself, or rather, it is magnetized. Minus: the case gets scratched, you need a case. And another minus: look how terribly dirty it gets! And it's hard to wipe off. I can't clean them after each use and this is what the case turns into."
My favorite apple wireless headphones!,zoiaf,5,2024-10-06,"My favorite apple wireless headphones!

"Apple AirPods with the charging case provide excellent wireless convenience, good sound quality, and long battery life, making them perfect for everyday use.",ellier186,4,2024-10-03,"Apple AirPods with the charging case offer a secure and comfortable fit for most users, even during long wear. The sound quality is clear and balanced, with decent bass for casual listening. Battery life is strong, providing up to 5 hours of listening on a single charge, with the case extending it to about 24 hours. They're lightweight and comfortable for extended use, though some may prefer ear tips for a tighter seal. Durability is solid for daily wear and tear, though they aren't fully water-resistant, so caution is needed in wet conditions."
An every day essential in my life.,amye234,5,2024-10-03,"As a busy mom and booklover, listening to audiobooks is an essential part of my day. Ever since the AirPods came out, I haven't seriously looked at another type of headphone. They connect so well to my iPhone and provide excellent sound quality while simultaneously reducing outside noise. They fit in my ear so well and are incredibly comfortable."
Perfect !,louist19,5,2024-10-03,"If you watch the demonstration on the YouTube link, it's very easy to use especially for those who may be not as tech savvy as others! I especially like the ability to hear what's playing but also be aware of someone talking to me when needed! Very comfortable in the ears. It doesn't matter what size your ear is‚Ä¶ I had tried the other version that had a silicone pad and they always fell out! Personally, I like to garden‚Ä¶ With my old earbuds, whenever I was reading or bending down to pick something out they would fall out and I sometimes lost them! However, with these, I have no problems whatsoever! For those of you in a relationship where one partner talks too much, extremely helpful in allowing one person to talk to friends while the other one can listen to their music by using the setting of noise cancellation! Relationship saver!!"

"Great quality, very comfortable, worth every penny",dilafruzd,5,2024-10-02,"Very comfortable headphones with good sound quality. The fit on the ear is perfect and never falls off or hurts my ears. It's very compact which allows to add it even into small bags. The battery life is good, but in a couple years it starts going bad, which is perfectly fine. I had my first pair for 3 years before the battery started acting up. Then I repurchased and have been using them for 2 years now and still love them."

Great day to day use,charmaines28,4,2024-10-02,"Comfort - Comfortable in The ears, fits right in. Box comes with 2 different size buds depending on what fits best for your ears Sound quality - good but not amazing, quality is similar to a good speaker but you won't hear unique features about it. It's your day to day earphones Battery Life - good. You can use continuously for a few hours or in and out throughout the day. You can also use one EarPod at a time while you charge the other. Durability - definitely needs protective case and DO NOT accidentally leave it in your clothing and wash it. Water damage will kill your aid pods very quickly. Favorite part of the pro version is the noise cancellation which is great at cancelling outside noise by half. Use it in the gym, meetings, or even in the plane."

Apple airpods with charging case are a 3 star pair of ear,christopherm167,4,2024-10-02,"The Apple AirPods with charging case offer decent sound quality, but they lack the depth and richness of higher-end earbuds.

Best Earbuds,yazana7,5,2024-10-01,At first I was very hesitant to buy these. I am used to headphones with a wire. I was worried about losing them or slipping out of my ear but they actually fit well and I never worry about them falling out. The sound and quality is great. The case is sleek and charge lasts for a long time.

APPLE IS THE BEST,hollyp161,5,2024-10-01,There's nothing better than an Apple product. Amazing sound quality and they never fall out of your ears. They can last me 3-4 hours honestly. I adore them.
,Andrea,1,2024-10-01,"Worked for couple of months. No one can't hear me, but I can hear them."
"Overall, I would not like it because this expensive item doesn't connect when is supposed to",loant17,1,2024-10-01,"The type of earpiece is very light and durable. The sound quality is sound proof. I wore it for a while it hurts my ears so much. I would say about 1 hour or so. The air pid battery life is a joke. It would drop so fast I was unaware. I charged all night, when I used it only a bit. When I started to take out the case it would not connect? I have no idea why it does that."
Apples convenience of a charging case,kimrac,5,2024-10-01,"My apple airpods are one of my frequently used accessories in life. With the comfort of always having at least one airpod in at all times the charging case makes it so much more efficient for me to keep them all day as one dies i charge it in the case and switch ears. No matter where I take them work, running or even just grocery shopping they have fallen here and there and it has never tempered with the quality of the product or my liking for them. They will continue to be my #1 accessory and my go-to to get through the day!"

Good,alyb56,5,2024-10-01,"Good quality, sound great. it's a solid choice if you want a way to listen to music, play games and use apps without the calling and mobile data capabilities of a phone."
What's not to like about music?,exxandohh,4,2024-10-01,These AirPods are great because the battery life is a few weeks without charging if you're using them for the gym. They have great sound quality‚Ä¶maybe even better than my car speaker! They never fall out of my ear either. A few cons is that one side can die sooner than the other which makes no sense & I did have issues charging that side for awhile but luckily the reset helped. Be careful not to drop them as it can affect your headphones severely.
Love my AirPods!,jessicap218,5,2024-10-01,I have been using them since they were created. I don't go to the store or do daily housework without them! They the perfect way to jam or listen to podcasts without distractions.

Do you have Apple products? Cannot go wrong with these!,mitchella1992,5,2024-09-30,"The Apple AirPods Pro offer a sleek, premium design with a focus on comfort and noise cancellation. Their compact, white stem design is signature Apple, and they come with three sizes of silicone tips, ensuring a snug fit for most ear shapes. The charging case is small, pocket-friendly, and has a solid, well-built feel with a smooth magnetic closure, making it easy to store and carry around. When it comes to sound, the AirPods Pro deliver impressive audio quality, especially for true wireless earbuds. The sound profile is balanced, with clear mids, crisp highs, and enough bass to satisfy most listeners. What really sets them apart is their active noise cancellation (ANC), which effectively blocks out background noise, whether you're on a noisy commute or in a busy caf√©. Transparency mode is equally impressive, letting outside sound in when you need to be aware of your surroundings, all with a quick tap. The AirPods Pro work seamlessly with Apple devices, connecting almost instantly thanks to the H1 chip. The integration with iOS is smooth, offering features like quick switching between devices and hands-free Siri. Touch controls are intuitive and allow you to manage playback, activate noise-canceling modes, or take calls with ease. Battery life is solid, offering up to 4.5 hours of listening time with ANC on, and the charging case extends this to more than 24 hours of total use. The case also supports wireless charging, which is a convenient bonus. Overall, the Apple AirPods Pro are an excellent choice for Apple users who want great sound, top-notch noise cancellation, and a comfortable fit. While they come at a higher price point, the combination of features, quality, and convenience makes them a worthy investment for those who are deep into the Apple ecosystem."

It is a must have item,sophiep232,5,2024-09-30,"I've been using the Apple AirPods (2nd Gen) for a few months now, and they've quickly become my go-to earbuds. Pairing them with my iPhone was incredibly easy, and I love how they automatically connect to all my Apple devices without any hassle. In terms of comfort, they fit well in my ears, but I know the open-ear design might not be the best for everyone, especially if you're running or working out intensely. For me, they're perfect for everyday use and casual walks. The sound quality is decent‚Äîclear and crisp, though they're not heavy on bass. If you're an audiophile, you might find them a bit lacking, but for podcasts, phone calls, and casual music listening, they're great. One of the best things is the battery life. I can get about 6 hours of listening time on a single charge, and the case gives me over a day of power, which is really convenient. I've even worn them in light rain, and they held up well thanks to their water resistance. Overall, I'm happy with them. They're not cheap, but if you're deep into the Apple ecosystem, they're definitely worth the investment!"

This is important, because almost every other headphones I've used have great sound quality on my end, but the people I'm speaking to can't hear me. I'm a bit concerned about the battery life, but I need to confirm this first. You do need to wear both pods to receive the full use of the batteries."

10/10,ariannab147,5,2024-09-28,"I use my AirPods every day, and they've become an essential part of my routine. Whether I'm listening to music, podcasts, or taking calls, the sound quality is always top-notch. They're incredibly convenient, especially with the seamless connection to my devices. I love how they fit perfectly in my ears and stay secure even when I'm on the go. The noise-cancellation feature is a game-changer, allowing me to focus in noisy environments. Plus, the battery life is impressive ‚Äì I rarely have to worry about charging them. Overall, my AirPods make my daily activities more enjoyable and efficient, and I can't imagine going without them."

Comfortable and awesome,andread408,5,2024-09-28,"My boys use these every day! They need them for school, and just the day to day. I did try them too. We love how comfortable they are, how long the battery lasts, and the noise cancelling."

"Music sounds average, call quality can be terrible.",mattk54,2,2024-09-28,"These are comfortable, but they fall out if you work out with them on, or do basic work around the house, or outdoors. The sound quality is not that great for the price. On top of that, when you talk on the phone outdoors there can be issues. If there is any type of wind, the person that you're on the phone with will have issues hearing you. Battery life is also short, and they need to be charged at least once daily. I didn't have any durability issues, but abandoned these for a different style of headphones that I'm much happier with."

Sound effects,rohang8,5,2024-09-28,"Just got my hands on these earlier today and these are great, the quality and sound quality on these are fantastic.

Best fit and function,katarae,5,2024-09-27,I love this model of AirPods because they fit perfectly in my ears. I've had this pair for 3 years and they still work perfectly. I can usually get 3 days worth of near constant use before needing to charge them again. I much prefer these because they're smaller and feet better in my ears than some of the newer models.

Great product !,heatherw473,5,2024-09-27,"I currently don't own airpods anymore because I lost both ear pieces. When I did have them, I thought the sound quality was one of the best out of all brands. The battery lasted for a while. I highly recommend airpods when shopping for headphones!"
The sound,isabelr323,5,2024-09-27,"I got my first pair in 2018 , fell in love instantly and was excited to get a case for my AirPods charging. I really enjoyed the sound and honesty was surprised they could be used on pc for gaming"

"Phone, wallet, keys, AirPods. They're a must-have",marybethg6,5,2024-09-27,"I love that I can get a full workday of wearing these in on one charge - I need music for deep work focus, & I'm SO much more productive with my AirPods on hand. The case & headphones all charge up quickly (perfect for when I'm forgetful), they're comfortable to boot, they block out my coworkers when necessary, & never fall out of my ears no matter what (plus I love not having to deal with wires - call me spoiled, but wires on typical headphones and my work headsets for meetings drive me nuts). I've bought multiple pairs over the years to have on-hand as a just-in-case, but have only needed to open a new box once, when I lost one of the AirPods as a result of them falling out of my sweatshirt pocket while deboarding a plane. My dad has purchased 3-4 less-expensive/lower-quality headphone brands over the years and they all have died within a year; three years ago I gave him a set of AirPods as a gift and he still uses the same pair."

Beware of online ordering!,Rebecca,5,2024-09-27,"I had first purchased a pair of these from amazon for the exact same price, but when I received them, a week later, the box clearly stated that they were refurbished, which the amazon site and product description made no mention of, trust me, I would not buy something used that you stick in an orifice of your body. I returned them which took 2 weeks to get my refund and promptly bought the pair from walmart which took all of 40 minutes, travel time included, and guess what, they were brand new. Thanx walmart."

Apple AirPods,judithelysse,4,2024-09-27,"These are the latest generation of AirPods. They are a really great technology that allows for me to hear phone calls, videos, and music seamlessly with my iPhone. The AirPods are great but they are not the most comfortable headphones to have in for a very long period of time. I think it's because of the way they fit in my ear. I will say that they are very durable and I have dropped them many times with no issue. The sound quality is excellent and I enjoy using them for shorter periods of time. I probably wouldn't take them on a run or for any high intensity workout. Overall, I think they're a great value. ÔøºÔøº Ôøº"

The sound quality is very clear and what's also great is that it can sync with both Apple and Samsung phones. Obviously, the Apple sync is much better (no disconnection and able to pause when take out of ear), but the Samdung one does just fine as well. Although, I will say, when you sync with Samsung, it will disconnect at times."

Uncomfortable and easily overpowered,trashxm0uth,3,2024-09-21,"There are a plethora of better and more cost effective options on the market than Apple AirPods.

recommend for cheap price,juliat229,5,2024-09-20,I owned several Airpods items but the orginal version is my favorite even Apple upgraded their item each year. I feel like the earbuds stay on your ear better and doesnt feel wet after you take it off. It's not sound proof like other version but sound still awesome. The battery lasts for several hours and wont take much time to charge.

High tech thin mint tin,shaddl,5,2024-09-20,"The Apple AirPods charging case looks like a futuristic Tic-Tac box, but instead of freshening your breath, it recharges your AirPods faster than you can lose them. It's tough enough to survive being dropped, yet so small it's always hiding in the black hole of your bag. Flicking it open is oddly satisfying, just be careful not to launch your AirPods across the room. Overall, it's the perfect companion‚Äîif only you could remember where you put it!"

Comfortable,annie1481,5,2024-09-18,"The AirPods (3rd Generation) are a great middle ground for those who want better sound and features. Improved sound quality with Adaptive EQ. Spatial Audio and Dolby Atmos support. Longer battery life (up to 30 hours with case). Sweat and water resistance MagSafe wireless charging Comfortable for most users. They have a more compact and contoured design, reminiscent of the AirPods Pro but without silicone ear tips. They are designed for an open fit, sitting just outside the ear canal. While this is comfortable for many, it doesn't provide a seal like in-ear models, so passive noise isolation is minimal. They're lightweight, making them comfortable for extended wear."

Good!,loverisadaytoday,3,2024-09-16,Very nice! These fit really well in my ears and are somewhat comfortable. They can slide out sometimes but overall they stay very well.

Quality and design,joshual25,4,2024-09-14,"The Apple EarPods with Charging Case offer a solid and reliable listening experience for Apple users. They have a comfortable, ergonomic design that fits well in most ears. The sound quality is clear and balanced, with a decent bass response, making them great for casual listening. The included charging case is compact and provides additional battery life, ensuring the EarPods last for extended use. However, they lack noise-cancellation features and aren't as secure for vigorous physical activity. Overall, they're a great choice for those who value simplicity and seamless integration with iOS devices."

Plus, the **Transparency Mode** lets you stay aware of your surroundings when needed. The battery life is solid, and the compact charging case provides multiple additional charges, ensuring you're powered up all day. Overall, AirPods offer a premium, user-friendly experience that's hard to beat."
"Good product, absolutely no issues with it.",hilaryl23,5,2024-09-13,The comfort of these AirPods were incredible and they didn't cause any pain! The sound quality was honestly amazing and it was such a nice base! The battery for them is so good lasted the entire school and work day which is good and they are so strong and they hold up very well and won't break on you.
"Great fit, design, and sound",spitza,5,2024-09-13,"These are 2nd generation AirPods and they are my favorite. I prefer the fit of the longer stem. They charge quickly and the charge lasts a good 6 hours on a single charge, which is enough for me. You can see on your phone how much charge is left. I have had these for a few years now, and they are my home base and workout go-tos. The sound is amazingly crisp and clear. I love the touch control, especially when I'm at the gym."

The sound quality is good, offering crisp highs and deep bass that elevate the overall music experience. Whether I'm listening to my favorite playlists, or even watching movies, the sound is consistently clear and immersive. The highs are sharp, while the bass delivers a satisfying punch, which is something I truly appreciate as someone who enjoys a broad range of music genres. They exceed my expectations, particularly for something so small and compact."

Going strong,brittanysf,5,2024-09-13,I got my first pair of AirPods as a hand me down from my brother and they have been going strong for 4+ years. The battery life on them is still surprisingly good and the sound quality is good as well. My one improvement would be the fit.they tend to fall out of my ear easily and I think the newer generation AirPods have improved this feature.

they are reliable earbuds that sound good,dylanp70,5,2024-09-12,this product is a very reliable set of ear buds. even though this pair does not have noise cancellation like its counter part AirPod pros it sounds amazing due to its price. This pair of earbuds will not give you ear fatigue like the Airpod pros have been proven to give but also provide a comforting fit. the battery life is not the best i have seen but insures that you make it through the day without worrying about them dying
Airpods,jessicac2142,4,2024-09-12,First time user and they are comfortable and quality sound. Easy and fast charging and only charge every few days. Good quality and colors and can customize.
Excellent Performance and Convenience!!,sarahj659,5,2024-09-12,"I'm more of a bass head so the AirPods Pro aren't exactly my match but they do have excellent sound. One thing about these that I love is the battery life. I like how I can kind of forget about it and they're still good to go for long hours.In terms on sound quality, they are as good as someone can expect. The bass is there while the highs are a bit too high for my liking, so I can never listen to music at full volume.Something really impressive about these is their clarity and noise cancellation. It has to be one of the best if not the best in the market. I'd say it cancels around 90% to 95% of outside noise without having anything playing.These are a great pick for anyone and they charged with usb c so why not !!"
"Best airpods, super comfortable !!",maeveh12,4,2024-09-12,"Battery life is very good, i can use it for two days. Also very good sound quality. Fits in your ear perfectly. It holds up nice. I would totally recommend this to anyone! especially those who do a lot of handwork and need airbuds."

I've had my AirPods for about 3 years now and they still work but of course having a product for a long time it can cause the product not to be the same but it the sound is great still. Very comfortable in my ears when I'm listening to music. And the battery life is also A+ as well because my AirPods battery lasted for 2-3 days before and it still does after 3 years."

When listening to music I love to turn it loud , but the bass doesn't hurt my ears at all . Battery life goes very well , it can stay charged for pretty much whole day . The only thing that wish I could do better is when I do yoga and have to turn to the side , it doesn't hold in really well . Other than that , it does its job."

Pretty good,amandar1062,3,2024-09-11,So I purchased these for myself during COVID-19 and they lasted a little over 2 years. I like the live listen feature that allows the AirPods to act as hearing aids by amplifying the sound around you. The sound quality is great but I think the case should definitely be more durable to minor drops and falls. I dropped one in a puddle and it stopped working but it still charged lol

Very comfortable to use along with great sound quality and durability.,alexandraf233,5,2024-09-10,I use my Apple AirPods every single day and I love them. Never have to worry about tangled wires because they're wireless. They fit well and has great sound.

,Demari,1,2024-09-10,Product not good. Can barely hear and don't work properly
high quality,milanag7,5,2024-09-10,"I've had these AirPods since 2020. They still sound and look brand new, case included. I accidentally left my left AirPod in my gray shorts pocket and without realizing, it was washed and dried. After discovering what occurred, I attempted to charge the AirPod and use it. Without troubleshooting, my AirPod began to charge in the case and automatically connected to my phone as if nothing happened. All I'm going to say is get them if you haven't. This is one of my many pairs of holy grail headphones! Thank you Apple for pure quality and performance!"
They are loud,anistonm2,4,2024-09-10,They are nice and work great and fit well and of loud and the battery life is long good for working out but I wish they had the noise canceling feature
Love them,CHRISTINA,5,2024-09-09,I absolutely love these pods! I've had several different wireless ear buds and these are by far my favorite. From Boise to Shockz the apple are best in my opinion.
Not my favorite,brookep249,4,2024-09-09,I like these but do not love them. The sound quality is great and they are very convenient. Battery life is great but does goes down the more you use them. I've dropped them several times and they have survived the falls. I wish they didn't hurt after long use but the shape of the ear bud actually hurts if I wear longer than an hour at a time.
Worth money,hannyo1,5,2024-09-09,"I decided to buy Airpods because of its convenience and efficiency. I usually charge them once a week but they last really long. They are good value for my money and super easy to use. The sound quality is crisp and the fit is perfect for me. The fit for my ears, and they stay securely in place, even during workouts or when I'm on the go. Bluetooth to the iPhone, and then it will automatically connect to the phone every time you use the AirPod. This product is fantasy!"
,Savannahgarren,5,2024-09-09,Works amazing I use them listen to prodacts and music while cleaning the house or going on a walk
Good,Devin,5,2024-09-09,Works as expected and my brother likes it. Got him a pair of them for his birthday present.
Worth the splurge!,staceym277,4,2024-09-09,"Honestly some of the best headphones/earphones around. I love these for the gym, work, and even on my leisure time for music or podcasts. The sound quality is fantastic and so is the noise cancellation. They last a long time, I can go about two days without charging. Only reason they're not 5 stars is because my ears do get sore after about 2-3 hours."
Super disappointed in Walmart!!,Wilma,1,2024-09-09,I unfortunately never received the air pods! The box was delivered but had been opened by someone before it was delivered! The bottom of the box had been cut and all that was left in the box was a piece of crumpled up brown paper. I reached out to Walmart and was told that basically I'm out of luck as it shows that it was delivered!!

,CJ,3,2024-09-09,The sound is ok but they don't stay in my ears. The Pros fit me better but these may work well for someone with bigger ear drum entrances. I purchased these because my Pros were stolen and their replacement was not in the budget. I bought a magnetic strap to put them in so that I don't lose them when they fall out of my ear.

Worked good,kareltam,4,2024-09-08,"These AirPods worked good and came in handy a lot. I've had them for a good while now and they still work.

Good but could be better,faisala7,4,2024-09-07,Seem to work well enough. I like the audio quality. The only complaint is there is a noise whenever my hair rubs up against them which is rather annoying considering I have long hair. I also wish these were a little smaller as even with the smallest insert they don't feel secure in my ears. Probably wouldn't buy another pair unless they're improved.
Life saving when traveling,maggiel145,5,2024-09-07,I travel a lot and these are a life saver. So comfortable and no wires. The sound quality is amazing along with the life of the battery. One solid charge and you are good for hours of listening.

For such little headphones, it's an incredible sound. I would highly recommend these. Service from Very was excellent as always."

Good airpods,jasond91,5,2024-09-06,I like this wireless charging case. The AirPods Pro are completely compatible with this charging case. The AirPods Pro's size and shape are precisely fitted into the molds. Plugging in AirPods initiates automatic charging. It works with the built-in iOS charging case program. iPhone is able to get and display the case's battery status. The earplugs won't accidentally fall out thanks to the powerful magnetic force of the cap. It's quite easy to use. The Bluetooth connection is strong and persistent throughout. Everything has a rather small size.

Comfort,cuongwf,5,2024-09-06,"I still remember the first time I opened the box of my Apple AirPods. I had always been skeptical about wireless earbuds, thinking they might fall out or not deliver the same sound quality as wired ones. But the moment I put them in, I was sold. They paired instantly with my iPhone, and the sound? Crystal clear. Whether I'm listening to my favorite playlist or taking calls on the go, the experience has been seamless. The charging case is incredibly convenient‚ÄîI just pop the AirPods back in, and they charge quickly, ready for the next use. Plus, I never realized how freeing it would be to ditch the wires. Now, I can't imagine going back. These AirPods have become an essential part of my daily routine"

Pro vs regular go with pro,taylord401,3,2024-08-30,I honestly really like AirPods but the pro with soundproof ability is the one you should purchase. The regular AirPods battery life is not good and doesn't stay well in ears if you're working out. The AirPods Pro is much better and worth the extra price tag

No Refund on Packages Delivered to Wrong Address,Ayzia,1,2024-08-30,"I never received this product; unfortunately, FedEx delivered to the wrong address. Walmart wouldn't refund because FedEx had delivered %26 told me to seek refund from my bank. My bank wouldn't refund because I needed to seek refund from Walmart or carrier. FedEx wouldn't refund because they have a contract with Walmart. So beware of ordering from Walmart. If products are wrongly delivered, it's a complete loss for the customer.

Good quality bad ear canal shape.,Rachel,4,2024-08-25,"The sound is awesome when I can keep them in my ears properly. I guess it's the shape of my ears but they constantly fall out.

Excellent Product,lyndseys57,4,2024-08-22,"Apple AirPods are popular wireless earbuds that have become a staple for many due to their seamless integration with the Apple ecosystem, convenience, and decent sound quality. They offer an easy setup process, with automatic pairing to Apple devices, and are known for their portability and comfort, making them suitable for various activities like commuting, exercising, or casual listening. The sound quality of AirPods is generally good for casual listeners. They provide a balanced sound profile with a decent amount of bass, clear mids, and highs. While not the top choice for audiophiles, they perform well for everyday use, including music, podcasts, and phone calls. The microphone quality is also commendable, ensuring clear voice transmission during calls. However, one issue I have experienced is occasional choppiness in the sound, which is why it has received 4 stars instead of 5."

Bad quality for price & brand,sylvias57,2,2024-08-22,Apple AirPods with charging case were all the rage when they were first introduced. I own the original style and also Air Pods pro. Unfortunately my more expensive newer air pods pro malfunctioned sooner than my original style pair. The original style pair now runs out of battery very quickly but at least both pods work. On my air pod pros the right pod does not work at all and will not connect which is very frustrating. I never used excessively so it is even more frustrating. I will most likely not purchase again.

"If you're on the fence, buy them!",rebeccap464,5,2024-08-21,I absolutely love my AirPods! I actually got my first pair for free and thought I'd resell them. I put them in my ears and was blown away by the technology! They were so comfortable AND the noise cancelling was AMAZING! With or without music. My husband and I love them so much we purchased another pair so we'd stop fighting over them. I keep a pair in my purse and use the other one when I want to get in the cleaning zone at home. These are truly fantastic earphones.

It's especially nice that you can easily switch between devices if you have, for example, an iPad and a MacBook. However, there are downsides‚Äî the price is steep, and in noisy places, the bass might be lacking. Overall, they're great headphones for everyday use."
Buy,zoeyw46,5,2024-08-21,I love my AirPods. The durability in it is very good. It sounds good and they are comfy. Is depends on how much you use them for their battery life and they fit well
"perfect sound, ideal fit!",xavierp12,5,2024-08-21,"I've tried a lot of headphones, but AirPods are the best. Its combination of comfort, sound quality and ease of use is second to none. The connection to my Apple devices is instant and seamless."
Still reliable,nadd3,5,2024-08-21,"The first-generation Apple AirPods with the charging case are a convenient and reliable option for wireless audio. The seamless pairing with Apple devices is a major plus, and the automatic connection when you put them in your ears is super convenient. The sound quality is decent for casual listening, with clear audio and a balanced bass, but it's not exceptional if you're looking for deep, immersive sound. The charging case is compact and keeps the AirPods powered up for a full day of use. However, after a few years, the battery life of the AirPods themselves tends to diminish, and the fit might not be secure for everyone during workouts. Overall, they're a solid choice for everyday use, especially for those already in the Apple ecosystem."

Great headphones for the an everday wear,deanr17,5,2024-08-21,"They fit well and don't seem to fall out when I am working around the house! They last throughout the day and sound quality is pretty good. Not a ton of lows, but the mids and highs come through clearly."
Best Delivery,Adut,5,2024-08-21,"I liked how it didn't take long, it was between the time I requested for my package to come, I also like how he put my package in the mailbox and not on the floor because it was raining on that day and if he would have to put my package on the floor it would ruined it since I got an electronic device. Best delivery."

"If you're on the fence, buy them!",rebeccap464,5,2024-08-21,I absolutely love my AirPods! I actually got my first pair for free and thought I'd resell them. I put them in my ears and was blown away by the technology! They were so comfortable AND the noise cancelling was AMAZING! With or without music. My husband and I love them so much we purchased another pair so we'd stop fighting over them. I keep a pair in my purse and use the other one when I want to get in the cleaning zone at home. These are truly fantastic earphones.
,WalmartCustomer,5,2024-08-21,"It's a birthday gift for my stepson, his dad and I have a pair plus the more updated one's as well. We figured why not start him off with these they are great plus if he shows he can be responsible for these we will upgrade him."

Great!,beautymatters77,5,2024-08-20,These are my go to headphones as an apple fanatic. Personally i refuse to use any technology besides apple‚Ä¶ if you know you know‚Ä¶ The battery life of these headphones last quite awhile and with the charging case it makes them last even longer. Even though mine are about 3 years old they still work just as good as when i first got them. After awhile i will say if you have them in for a couple hours they will begin to hurt but that can be said about any earbud.
Great sound and long lasting,kaitmariee4,5,2024-08-20,I've had these for several years and they still work great! Use them everyday and charge once a week. The sound quality is excellent. These also fit in my ears perfectly and are very comfortable.

"Great sound quality, could be more durable.",abigails339,4,2024-08-20,The noise cancellation feature is very effective and sound is clear. They only last about a year which is disappointing for the price. Comfortable but after long periods of use the fit is slightly painful.

Best headphones yet by apple.,josephc134,4,2024-08-20,"The Apple AirPods (3rd Generation) are a fantastic upgrade. The moment I put them in, I was impressed by their comfort and secure fit.

Battery life is impressive, easily lasting through a full day of use. The charging case is compact and convenient. Pairing with my iPhone was seamless. The force sensor for controls is intuitive and responsive. Overall, the AirPods offer a premium audio experience and are a must-have for Apple users."

Decent quality headphones,kiwikeeli,4,2024-08-20,"These are good quality! I said good, not great. I was sitting in the sauna at the gym the other day and this man had a pair of these. I could hear the lyrics in his song, sitting all the way across from him! Homeboy had it up too loud, but I've also noticed these buds just don't handle high volumes. Unless you don't mind bothering everyone around you with your music! I try to be aware of my volume levels when using these in public because like I said, you can hear it outside of the buds. At home I'll wear them all day! They connect fast to my iPhone, and hold a decent charge. I use these when I'm trying to watch my funny TikTok's and not annoy my husband to the heavens! These are good for at home use personally."

Apple AirPods with Charging Case!,jillian31201,5,2024-08-20,"Apple AirPods with Charging Case Review The Apple AirPods with Charging Case are a top choice for wireless earbuds, blending convenience and quality. Their lightweight, minimalist design fits comfortably in most ears, though the one-size-fits-all approach may not suit everyone. Sound quality is crisp and balanced, ideal for casual listeners, though bass enthusiasts might find the low-end lacking. The H1 chip ensures seamless connectivity, especially within the Apple ecosystem, making pairing and switching between devices effortless. Features like automatic ear detection and ‚ÄúHey Siri‚Äù add to the user-friendly experience.

Old version,Saul,1,2024-08-19,"Old version. No wireless charging. H1 chip instead of H2 chip and it definitely makes a difference. Lag. Price is 30 dollars too high for what you get in return. EarFun Air pro 3 is much better on Amazon. Returned them. Walmart claims I used a credit card and clearly it was not, it was a debit card and Walmart just wanted to keep my money in store. Gave return money on gift card. Such a scam"

They're great,jonathonm8,5,2024-08-16,"The Apple AirPods with Charging Case deliver a compelling blend of convenience, sound quality, and integration with Apple's ecosystem. The AirPods themselves offer a seamless experience with automatic pairing and easy access to Siri. They provide clear, balanced sound with decent bass, though audiophiles might find them lacking compared to higher-end options. The Charging Case is a standout feature, allowing for extended use without frequent recharging. It offers up to 24 hours of battery life, making them ideal for all-day wear. The case itself is compact and easily fits into pockets or bags. The addition of wireless charging support in the case adds to the convenience, allowing for easy top-ups with any Qi-compatible charger. Overall, the AirPods with Charging Case are a strong choice for users in the Apple ecosystem, combining excellent portability with reliable performance. However, for those who prioritize advanced sound quality or noise cancellation, other options may be worth considering."

They offer a great combination of convenience, sound quality, and seamless connectivity.",michaeld183,5,2024-08-14,"The Apple AirPods have been a game-changer in the wireless earbud market since their initial release. Here's an overview of their key features, strengths, and some areas for improvement: Key Features: 1. **Design**: AirPods have a sleek, minimalistic design with a stem that makes them easy to adjust and remove. The charging case is compact and convenient for on-the-go use. 2. **Sound Quality**: The sound is balanced, with clear highs and mids. The bass is decent but may not satisfy audiophiles seeking deeper low-end frequencies. However, the AirPods Pro and AirPods Max offer enhanced sound quality with features like Active Noise Cancellation (ANC). 3. **Connectivity**: Seamless integration with Apple devices is one of the standout features. Pairing is almost instant, and the connection is stable. Switching between Apple devices, like an iPhone and MacBook, is smooth thanks to Apple's H1 or W1 chip. 4. **Battery Life**: The AirPods offer around 4.5 to 5 hours of listening time on a single charge, with additional charges provided by the case. The AirPods Pro slightly reduce this to around 4.5 hours with ANC on. The case can provide up to 24 hours of total listening time. 5. **Comfort**: The standard AirPods have a one-size-fits-all approach, which may not work for everyone. However, they are generally comfortable for extended wear. The AirPods Pro come with customizable silicone tips, offering a more secure fit and better noise isolation. 6. **Features**: With Siri integration, voice commands are easy to use. Features like automatic ear detection and spatial audio (on newer models) add to the overall experience. The Pro version's noise cancellation is effective, and the Transparency Mode is useful when you need to be aware of your surroundings. Strengths: - **Ease of Use**: The AirPods are incredibly user-friendly, especially within the Apple ecosystem. Pairing and using them require minimal effort. - **Portability**: The small size and convenient charging case make them perfect for travel or everyday carry. - **Software Updates**: Apple frequently updates its AirPods with new features and improvements via software updates. Areas for Improvement: - **Price**: AirPods are relatively expensive compared to other wireless earbuds, especially considering that the sound quality, while good, may not be the best in this price range. - **Fit**: The one-size-fits-all design may not be ideal for everyone, leading to potential discomfort or a loose fit during physical activities. - **Durability**: While the build quality is decent, the AirPods and charging case can be prone to wear and tear over time, and replacing a lost or damaged AirPod can be costly."
"Battery stopped working, lasted 8 months",MCH,1,2024-08-14,"Despite being very gentle with these, and not using them much, after 8 months these AirPods no longer can hold a charge. I will charge it to %100 and not use it, then the next day it will be back down to 0%. It's become a headache. Feels like they may have been used before and refurbished. The sellers return policy is crappy so can't return them. They were a waste of money. Next time I'll buy from someone with a better return policy."

"The Apple AirPods with Charging Case offer seamless integration with Apple devices, impressive battery life, and convenience, though they may lack deep bass and a customizable fit.",techbytereview,4,2024-08-11,"Apple AirPods with Charging Case Review: As an avid user of the Apple AirPods with Charging Case, I'm excited to share my experience with this popular product. From daily commutes to intense workout sessions, these AirPods have become an integral part of my daily life. Here's a detailed look at their performance, along with some pros and cons.Performance and FeaturesThe Apple AirPods with Charging Case offer a seamless experience that aligns perfectly with the Apple ecosystem. The setup process is incredibly simple‚Äîjust open the case near your iPhone, and you're connected in seconds. The integration with iOS is smooth, and features like automatic switching between Apple devices make multitasking effortless.The sound quality of the AirPods is impressive for their size. They deliver crisp highs and balanced mids, though they might lack the deep bass that some audiophiles seek. The audio experience is quite satisfactory for everyday use, including calls, music, and podcasts.Battery LifeThe battery life is one of the standout features. Each AirPod lasts around 5 hours on a single charge, and the charging case provides an additional 24 hours of listening time. The case itself charges quickly and supports wireless charging, which is a convenient touch.Comfort and FitComfort is subjective, but for me, the AirPods have been quite comfortable to wear. They fit securely in my ears without feeling intrusive, and I've worn them for extended periods without discomfort. However, the universal fit may not suit everyone, and some users might experience issues with the AirPods not staying in place during vigorous activities.ProsSeamless Integration: Perfectly pairs with Apple devices and offers features like automatic switching.Battery Life: Impressive overall battery life with both AirPods and charging case.Convenience: The wireless charging case and ease of use are significant advantages.Comfort: Generally comfortable for extended wear with a lightweight design.ConsSound Quality: While good, it may not satisfy audiophiles who prefer richer bass.Fit Issues: The one-size-fits-all design might not be ideal for everyone, potentially leading to fit issues.Price: At a higher price point compared to some competitors, the value for money might be questioned.Lack of Active Noise Cancellation: These AirPods do not have noise-cancelling features, which could be a downside for users who need isolation from external noise.ConclusionThe Apple AirPods with Charging Case are a solid choice for users within the Apple ecosystem, offering convenience, good battery life, and satisfactory sound quality. They excel in ease of use and integration but might fall short for those seeking top-tier audio performance or a more customizable fit. Overall, if you're looking for a reliable pair of wireless earbuds that work seamlessly with Apple products, the AirPods are worth considering."

Worthwhile Investment with Limited Longevity,bk1818,4,2024-08-08,"I love my Apple AirPods and will continue to repurchase them. They connect effortlessly to my iPhone, deliver high-quality sound, and let me skip songs with a simple tap. I love how they fit in my ear and I have never had to worry about them falling out. The fast recharge in the case is incredibly convenient. However, I've noticed they only tend to last a few years, which is disappointing given the price. I wish they would improve the lifespan.

Flexibility,misah4,4,2024-08-08,"AirPods is my favorite on the go. The freedom of cordless gives me flexibility while walking working, or gymming. The battery duration is the limitation of using AirPods, only last for few hours before it dies."
Worthwhile Investment with Limited Longevity,bk1818,4,2024-08-08,"I love my Apple AirPods and will continue to repurchase them. They connect effortlessly to my iPhone, deliver high-quality sound, and let me skip songs with a simple tap. I love how they fit in my ear and I have never had to worry about them falling out. The fast recharge in the case is incredibly convenient. However, I've noticed they only tend to last a few years, which is disappointing given the price. I wish they would improve the lifespan. Despite this, when they are in their prime, they are absolutely worth it."

Great set of earphones,leahlubelle,5,2024-08-08,We love our AirPods. We use them for listening to music and movies. They connect really easily to an iPhone and iPad.

The case not only keeps them neat and tidy but it also charges at the same time. They fit well in the ear. Quality is great. Highly recommend.

Nice AirPod,ngann30,5,2024-08-07,I bought these over 2 years ago and they still work great. They were originally a gift for my mom but she ended up preferring wired headphones so I kept them.

Other than that they're great. The sound quality is fantastic and they last a long time without having to charge.

Perfect headphones for every day,marimarz1,5,2024-08-06,"I really enjoy using the airpods because normal headphones fall off my head very easy. I l also like how it is so easy to skip songs and light weight. I dislike that their battery is not the best, I find myself constantly recharging them."
Battery is abysmal.,Lauren,1,2024-08-06,"Might have gotten a defective pair, but the battery doesn't hold a charge for more than a day after fully charging. Even if they are not used at all during the day following a full charge, they will still be completely dead the next day. Not sure if this is typical performance for air pods, as this is my first pair. Either way, sending them back. Don't have much use for ear buds that have to be charged every single day regardless of use."
easy dirty,nguyenm7,5,2024-08-06,"Love the fit and finish of my AirPods. Comfortable and they don't hurt my ears after hours of listening. These AirPods deliver superb sound quality and seamless connectivity. The compact design is convenient for on-the-go use, and the automatic pairing feature is incredibly user-friendly. Battery life is impressive, with quick charging in the The fit is comfortable, making them perfect for long listening sessions. Althouah not the cheapest option, their performance and ease of use justify the cost."
Best hands free AirPods!,girl_with_1eye,5,2024-08-06,"I adore my AirPods! They are so useful! I love that they are hands free. I can be listening to my books on tape or musics while I clean, walk, or work. It's so easy to switch h to talk to someone when they call me. They sound amazing. I'm able to change songs, pause songs, make it so it cancels out all sound or set it to hear background sounds. It's so lovely! I used them for about 12 hours with minimal charging and they lasted so well! I will continue to use them and buy them. I love the ear piece. I feel like the other type is prone to burning your ears if you were them a long period of time!"

iPods 2 purchase,C,5,2024-08-04,I've tried other more inexpensive products and they just don't compare to the iPods. I bought these a great price and am extremely happy. The sound quality is crisp and clear. Only downfall is there is no adjustability in the ear fit.
AIR PODS,Garrett,4,2024-08-04,They are amazing but the battery is Horrible Otherwise amazing product
,Alejandro,5,2024-08-04,The airpods are of excellent quality. They have a perfect fit for my ear.
Don't recommend,Mya,1,2024-08-04,Please don't purchase apple product just because it's on sale or less expensive than other place. I barely use my AirPod and the battery life already sucks. I can't return as it's pass 90 days and i didn't have the box. I would give zero star if I could.

,Arlene,1,2024-08-04,"I very much dislike that the order of Apple ipods was not delivered to me. The address was correct. However, the picture taken is NOT my house! You could look on a Google map and see that it is not my house. Walmart REFUSES to even discuss the issue. They told me to notify my credit card company and put it in a DISPUTE!!!!! TERRIBLE customer service."

This a second order. Love this AirPods for my son,Chelzwic,4,2024-08-01,I will not order for home delivery because the AirPods were a regular Walmart shopping bag and left open on the ground.

No goo for me!,Betty,2,2024-08-01,They don't fit my ears %26 they sound tinney which is why I bought new ones to begin with.

Bad,Dipo,1,2024-07-25,My AirPods do not charge fully for some odd reason. When playing music it constantly cuts out and I'm beside my phone. I've never had any issues with AirPods so this is odd. These aren't refurbished AirPods so I'm genuinely concerned as to what the issue is?

Sounds great,evelino12,5,2024-07-24,"I recently purchased the Apple AirPods, and I am thoroughly impressed with their performance. Whether you're using the first or second generation, these wireless earbuds deliver a fantastic audio experience. First and foremost, the sound quality is exceptional. The AirPods provide clear, crisp audio with a well-balanced range, making music, podcasts, and calls sound great. The seamless integration with Apple devices is another standout feature. Pairing the AirPods with my iPhone was incredibly easy and quick, thanks to the H1 chip in the second generation (and W1 chip in the first). The connection remains stable even when I'm moving around. The convenience of the wireless design cannot be overstated. The AirPods fit comfortably in my ears and stay in place during various activities, from working out to commuting. The charging case is compact and keeps the earbuds secure while providing multiple charges on the go. Battery life is impressive, offering several hours of continuous use on a single charge. Additionally, the built-in microphone works well for phone calls and voice commands. Siri integration is smooth and responsive, allowing for hands-free control over my device."

Best gift I've ever received!,aliciarrr,5,2024-07-24,"Not a day goes by I don't use my AirPods! As mentioned in the video, I was very skeptical of these being a realistic product. Assuming they would fall out of your ears, constantly get lost, etc. I could barely get regular earbuds to stay put. But clearly I underestimated the folks at Apple. I was gifted a pair of first generation AirPods and will never go back to corded earbuds or over ear headphones. The audio quality is great, the noise cancellation is very impressive, and I don't think they've ever fallen out of my ears. Years later, they hold a charge just as good as day 1. All of this combined with Apple's intuitive suite of products and software is‚Ä¶ *chef's kiss* I love to pop one in while I'm working on my laptop and my boyfriend watches TV, so we can both do our own thing simultaneously. 10/10"

"1.	Pairing: Easily connects to Apple devices. 	2.	Sound Quality: Good, but not ideal for audiophiles. 	3.	Battery Life: About 5 hours on a single charge. 	4.	Durability: Durable for regular use but not water or dust resistant.",poli1995,5,2024-07-24,"Apple AirPods offer a seamless and convenient wireless audio experience. Their compact design makes them easy to carry and use, with a comfortable fit for most users. The sound quality is crisp and balanced, with good bass and clear highs, though they may not match high-end headphones in audio fidelity. The integration with Apple devices is excellent, featuring quick pairing and smooth connectivity through the Apple ecosystem. Battery life is impressive, with AirPods providing around 5 hours of use on a single charge and up to 24 hours with the charging case. Noise cancellation is minimal, so they may not be ideal for very noisy environments. However, their convenience, ease of use, and integration with Apple products make them a strong choice for everyday wireless earbuds. Apple AirPods are generally well-built and durable for everyday use. The outer casing is resistant to minor scratches and wear, while the charging case provides additional protection. However, they are not waterproof or sweat-resistant, so exposure to moisture or intense physical activity can affect their longevity. Battery life can degrade over time with regular use, leading to shorter listening times between charges. Careful handling and proper storage in the charging case can help extend their lifespan. Overall, AirPods are durable for typical usage but may require attention to maintenance and care."

Afortable and long lasting,,5,2024-07-24,"Love these my dad gave me his lol but the price was good , battery life last sometimes I forget to charge the case and it last me a while so works amazing , the sound is 100 amazing you can hear background noises , they are comfortable on the ears and good size to time on the go! And I have dropped it more then once and they don't break on mean I'm surprised that the case lasted as well since it's taking more of the damage but still works wonders!!"

Not as good as the 3g,jack,2,2024-07-24,"If you've never had 3 or better, it's okay. Not as good as the G 3 or bettter."
I have never regretted the purchase.,irinad38,5,2024-07-24,"Very comfortable to wear. Charges quickly. Minimalist design. Excellent sound and microphone quality. Durable to use. I have been using them for three years now, during which time they have never let me down. The charging case and headphones also last a long time, and the case also charges quickly. They sit very comfortably in the ear, I don't feel any discomfort when wearing them for a long time. They don't fall out of the ear. Also I like the design and shape of case."
,WalmartCustomer,5,2024-07-24,"AirPods had the best price, were available and delivery was super fast. Purchased through app and every step of the way was communicated."
Love them,jessiej21,5,2024-07-24,These are very durable. The sound quality is good but could be better. They're comfortable but if you leave them in your ear too long your ear will hurt. They fit great. I wish they had a longer battery life but the charging case does. Would recommended and re buy.
Get these headphones!!,emilym1744,5,2024-07-24,These are by far the most comfortable and nice headphones I've owned. I usually only have to charge them every week or so and they don't damage easily. The sound quality is the best I've ever used in wireless headphones!

Works but could be better,quedicelaflaca,3,2024-07-24,These AirPods work great but after a while it seems the battery life does not last as long and the sound quality could be better on these as well. I have small ears so the fit isn't always comfortable.

Quality is great !!!,anitab148,5,2024-07-24,"Starting this review off by saying that the sound on these are one of the best especially if you're a person like me that likes to blast music in their ears üòÇ, the ONLY downside is the battery life of the earphones themselves , the charging case is great but the earphones die a little too quickly for me. Lastly, the fit is great and they're pretty much comfortable.‚ò∫Ô∏è"
These are amazing,juleahr,5,2024-07-24,I love AirPods! I have no problem hearing at all. They are durable and a great quality. Definitely recommend them For anyone! Best out there! Try them

Quality is everything,elizabethr575,5,2024-07-24,"I love my AirPods even though after like 5 years one of them already gave up on me. I've tried everything and nothing works. They both start playing and a couple of seconds into it. One of the headphones stops why I don't know, but I still love it my headphones specially when I work out. Ôøº"
Good earbuds,lilyw195,5,2024-07-24,"I have had these bad boys since high school and they haven't failed me yet. I like the wired earbuds that used to come with the iPhones but these will do, I think they are just as comfortable. The battery can goes days, and be charged quickly in like 2 hours."
High quality,lizak41,5,2024-07-24,"I working all day without possibility to charge my air phones. Battery life is long as I need. I like purity of sound. The one of important thing for me is a comfort. I like how it fit on my ears. In connection with my work, my AirPods often fall on the floor, but in two years nothing has happened. recommend it."

So comfortable!,tomey1,5,2024-07-24,Such a great product! It sits on my ears so comfortably that I sometimes forget it's there. At the same time it stays in place and has never came off my ears before. The sound quality is great for the price. Would recommend to anyone looking for earbuds!
Being a hands free helps.,angeleel,4,2024-07-24,I love my AirPods they allow me to be hands free whole being the busy mama I am. I do wish they had noise cancellation tho.
100% recommended,olgas185,5,2024-07-24,"Very convenient to use. They hold a charge for a long time. I always listen to music in them, play games, and communicate via video conference. I don't feel them on me. They have great sound. I've been using them for 3 years now and they are my favorite headphones."
They're definitely my go to!,,5,2024-07-24,I love these AirPods!! I have purchased about 3 pair. I love that they don't fall out of my ear like other earbuds I have tried. I will continue to buy these over other brands and types because the sound is great. I love that it pauses the music once I take one out. I charge mine maybe every week and I use them often. I live that you can see the battery life of each individual one. Also being able to track them via the Find My app is a major plus! You're able to find so many cute cases too. I have no complaints on these.
The best battery ever!,carlosm192,5,2024-07-24,I love my AirPods as soon as I got them I noticed they're so comfortable and beautiful. Other thing I'd like to point out is that the battery last for hours. Simply the best product ever !

"With great sound quality and a chargjng case, you'll always have wireless headphone access.",sabreenag1,4,2024-07-24,"These are good products for beginners. With good sound quality, charging case to charge your AirPods is a plus and definitely worth a purchase."
Best Wireless Hedphones I Have Ever Tried!!,giadar21,4,2024-07-24,"Apple AirPods are pretty sleek and lightweight, with that shiny white look. They sound clear and balanced, good for all kinds of music. The best part is how easily they connect to Apple devices, thanks to the W1 or H1 chip, and pairing is super simple. Battery life is decent, around 5 hours of listening and up to 24 with the charging case. They have cool features like Siri and automatic ear detection. They're not waterproof but tough enough for daily use. They might be a bit pricey, but their performance and how well they work with other Apple stuff make them worth it. üòÅ"
Horrible,Gabriel,1,2024-07-23,You gave me 1st gen airpods NOT WHAT I PAID FOR now i have to pay an extra 75$ to get my right airpod upgraded to second genüò°

Buy ‚Äòem,,5,2024-07-22,I have purchased a few different ear buds in the $20 range. Sounded okay but maybe little weak. Got the air pods 2nd generation at a very good discount price. More $ but well worth it. Just for the bass response alone. What a difference. If you can get them on sale you get Apple quality and top notch sound at a true entry level price. Buy ‚Äòem!!

Providing seamless connectivity and features like Siri integration and automatic device switching.,shannons565,5,2024-07-21,"Apple AirPods are known for their lightweight design and comfortable fit. They are designed to be worn for extended periods without causing discomfort. Providing a balanced sound profile suitable for most genres of music and podcast listening.

Well built and durable for their size. The materials used are resilient to everyday wear and tear, such as scratches and minor drops."
"My neighbors are going to start complaining, lol!",Madreg60,5,2024-07-21,"Clear, sharp sound! Easy to control with just a couple of taps. Comfortable on the ears. So far, they've never ran out of charge, so I don't know how long they last, but I wear them while I work for hours in the yard! I was getting so into the music, I forgot myself and was bellowing along at full volume! My wife came out to let me know she was leaving to run an errand, and she was laughing at my singing! Fortunately, my neighbors were at work,so no cops were called, ha ha! Needless to say, I'm really enjoying them and was thrilled to find them for 50% off, even if it isn't the latest generation.

Not so great fit but the sound is!,caroll120,3,2024-07-20,"Although more comfortable than the newer versions, they don't fit in the ear as easily. I'm always worried about them slipping out. I would say they're pretty sturdy and last a pretty long time before needing to charge! It's still able to do the noise cancelling so the sound is pretty good but it does feel like outside noise slips in every now and then."

Worth the price!,mommagordas,4,2024-07-20,"Let me start off with that I was always skeptical about these. But when I finally got a pair, I will never go back!

Apple AirPods,Misty,5,2024-07-20,I've always loved Apple products! I have sensitive ears %26 earpieces usually don't stay in and hurt my ears. Love how these sit in your ears
Review of Apple AirPods with Charging Case,olgak71,4,2024-07-20,"Design: The AirPods design is sleek and minimalistic, which I love. They're super lightweight and fit snugly in my ears without feeling bulky. The white color looks clean and matches my other Apple devices perfectly. Sound Quality: I'm impressed with the sound quality, especially considering their size. The highs and mids are clear, making vocals and instrumentals sound great. However, I do wish the bass was a bit stronger, as it can feel a bit light on some tracks. Wireless Performance: Connecting them to my iPhone was a breeze. They paired instantly as soon as I opened the case, and the Bluetooth connection has been rock solid. I haven't experienced any dropouts, even when moving around. Battery Life: Battery life is decent. I get about 5 hours of listening time on a single charge, which is enough for my daily commute and workouts. The case charges them quickly, and I can get multiple charges out of it before needing to plug it in. - Seamless integration with Apple devices - Lightweight and comfortable fit - Clear sound quality for vocals and highs - Quick and reliable Bluetooth connection - Convenient wireless charging case If you're already invested in the Apple ecosystem and want hassle-free wireless earbuds that work seamlessly with your iPhone, the Apple AirPods with Charging Case are a solid choice. They're not perfect, but they deliver on convenience and quality where it matters most to me. This review reflects my personal experience and preferences with the Apple AirPods with Charging Case, highlighting their strengths and areas where they could improve."
Nice product,Yingying96189,5,2024-07-20,"(This review was collected as part of a promotion.)

Light as a feather,bohemianbabe91,5,2024-07-20,I absolutely love my AirPods and do not know how i ever functioned with my walk-man cd player. No hassle at all! No annoying cords to deal with.

Perfect Gift For Everyone,Amirpouya44500,5,2024-07-19,"(This review was collected as part of a promotion.)

Review on AirPods,Amal22788,5,2024-07-19,"(This review was collected as part of a promotion.) I love this version of apple AirPods, especially because they have noise cancellation, a feature not available in other generations."

Not much to say about a Apple product,John,3,2024-07-19,To be fair Im not a fan of any Apple product. With that said my daughter wanted a pair of pods. I can say the sound quality is ok. If you are in the market for ear buds do yourself a favor and look into a pair of Staus pure audio. Status pods have much better sound quality. Hipe this helps someone.
Love them,Keishly,5,2024-07-19,"They're loud and they don't make my ears sweat like the AirPod pro's. Only downfall is that you can't charge it wirelessly, but it's no biggie"
Great buy,anastasiaa79,5,2024-07-19,The noise cancellation is better that I initially anticipated. Works great for a train ride or a run. They fit nicely in the ears. Battery life so far holds up to the original longevity.

BE WARE: Performance is much worse on non-Apple devices,aitlynkay,3,2024-07-17,"AirPods have a beautifully sleek and distinctive design. They don't fall out of your ear when walking, running, rolling over in bed, and playing sports, unless you intentionally force them to. They are comfortable to wear and can easily fit into your pocket, and the battery life lasts around 4 hours on one go, but you can always put them back into the case to charge them back up without a charger. However, if your AirPods are not connected to an Apple account, you will not be able to change the Bluetooth display name or track their location. While using non-Apple devices such as Androids or Windows, the audio will not stop when your AirPods are taken out of your ear, tapping on them will not pause or skip songs, and you can not check the battery percentage. The audio quality is also much worse when you do not use an Apple device, but is still acceptable for the average user. However, AirPods still work with various non Apple products, as long as they have Bluetooth, but the experience is not as good as it would be if you used an Apple device."
Worth it!,kaylinabeachpreppy,4,2024-07-17,These where very good but the only problem I experienced with them was how easy they where to lose. But other than that it has amazing sound quality and are definitely comfortable! They are a bit pricey but definitely worth it!

Raggedy,Tacoya,1,2024-07-16,Haven't had them a full week yet and the left side doesn't work.
Good sound and comfort,tetianap22,5,2024-07-16,"Packaging. Oh, all in the style of apple, indeed, their packaging is universal chic, they are always made qualitatively, firmly, stylishly. The capsule is very tiny, you can't even imagine how much stuff it has inside! It's amazing! The cover opens with ease and also with ease closes, I believe the cover is on magnets, closes tightly. The case charges from 0 to 100% very quickly, it charges for a week, maybe a little less, depending on how often you listen to music and charge the headphones. Connect via bluetooth to your phone easily.When connected, they immediately show how much charge the case and headphones have, as well as the name of the iPods on top. The sound is a bit peculiar, or maybe it's just a bit of an adjustment, because then you get used to it and the sound is exactly the same as on earpods. The sound from the microphone is clear. Comfortable in the ears, does not interfere. If you catch it, you can lose it."
The best investment I've ever made.,chelsearenee42dff054,5,2024-07-16,Adequate and comfortable to fit my small ears the sound quality is a 10/10 the battery longevity is exquisite. If you are considering buying it is a great item to invest in.

Comfortable & Great sound quality - Would recommend this to others.,trangt34,5,2024-07-16,"Looove these headphones! This is my first real hands-free headphones, to be honest and they are going great so far. Pairing is super easy. There are shortcuts you can access using the headphones that each user can assign to. For example, double tap on the right ear for Siri OR skip to next song (depending on what you choose to assign the tap motion to in the Settings option."" Also, the re-chargeable case is genius! They charge up each EarPod super fast and is a great way to store the headphones. Cute and compact case. Plus, there are many decorative cases for Apple AirPods case. Comfortable & Great sound quality!"

Quality sound and long lasting battery.,johnnyt23,5,2024-07-16,"Apple AirPods are a top pick for users who prioritize smooth integration with Apple products, quality audio, and user-friendly features. With a comfortable design and long-lasting battery, they are ideal for daily use. Nevertheless, the high cost, potential fit issues for some, and limited sound customization might be downsides. For those deeply embedded in the Apple ecosystem, AirPods are highly appealing, though similar alternatives at a lower price exist in the market."

Disappointed!!,NatalieC,1,2024-07-15,"This is extremely disappointing that I was not only called a liar, in lack of better words, when in fact it has been proven by multiple representatives that I did NOT receive my order. I have placed another order now having to pay extra due to Walmarts error, not mine. What was said was ‚Äúmy system is not allowing me that option‚Äù. These are gifts for my children and if this second order isn't received again I be ensuring to let others know of this as being what I would hate to call a SCAM! I hope someone can reach out to me with a better solution, as this is not acceptable."

Good quality for audio but slightly uncomfortable,alexandriaw56,3,2024-07-15,I have the original Air Pods (i know i should update but they still work so I'll wait lol). They are very good sound quality but i happen to have fairly sensitive ears so they aren't the most comfortable in my ears. Overall i use them pretty frequently but i can't use them for a long duration of time. They're great for if you're doing activities that are more hands on and you can't actively pause/chang songs from your phone instead you can just tap an earbud!

Durable,stars41,4,2024-07-15,The comfort of these AirPods are 6/10 and the sound quality isn't all that either but they do last for a good time and are durable. As for the battery life it goes down quickly.
Maybe worth it,rexd3,5,2024-07-15,"The Apple AirPods with charging case have become a ubiquitous sight, and for good reason. They offer a compelling combination of seamless integration with Apple devices, decent sound quality, and ease of use. **Pros:** * **Seamless integration with Apple devices:** Pairing is effortless, the 'Hey Siri' functionality works flawlessly, and the AirPods automatically switch between devices. This level of integration is unmatched for Apple users. * **Decent sound quality:** While not audiophile-grade, the AirPods offer a balanced sound with enough bass for most listeners. The audio quality is comparable to other wireless earbuds in this price range. * **Comfortable fit:** The AirPods have a comfortable, lightweight design that stays securely in your ears, even during moderate activity. * **Easy to use:** The touch controls on the AirPods are intuitive, allowing for seamless control of music playback and calls. * **Convenient charging case:** The charging case provides multiple charges for the AirPods, offering a decent amount of battery life on the go. **Cons:** * **Price:** The AirPods are priced at a premium compared to other wireless earbuds on the market, which might make them a difficult purchase for budget-conscious consumers. * **Lack of noise cancellation:** Unlike some competitors in the market, the AirPods lack noise cancellation, which may be a dealbreaker for users seeking a more immersive listening experience in noisy environments. * **Limited customization:** The AirPods offer minimal customization options for sound settings and touch controls. * **Fit issues for some users:** While generally comfortable, the AirPods' one-size-fits-all design can be a problem for users with smaller or larger ears, who might find them loose or uncomfortable. **Overall:** The Apple AirPods with charging case are a solid choice for Apple users seeking a comfortable and convenient wireless earbud experience. Their seamless integration with Apple devices, decent sound quality, and ease of use make them a compelling option. However, the lack of noise cancellation, premium price, and limited customization options may be dealbreakers for some. **Recommendation:** If you are an Apple user looking for a user-friendly, well-integrated earbud solution and are willing to pay a premium, the Apple AirPods with charging case are worth considering."

Comfortable and good bass but only held charge for a few hours,bbhuey2000,4,2024-07-15,Work very well. The sound could have been a little louder but the bass was really good. I'm a welder so I didn't care for the magnetic case because it collected a lot of metal shavings which were hard to remove and ended up causing the airbuds to fail. The fit nicely in my ears and were comfortable. I could use them for about 6 hours straight before having to charge them

2nd generation,jazmina140,3,2024-07-14,I am going to give these a 3 star because my AirPods did not last as long as I wanted it to. Both pods gave out eventually and never worked again.

Love Apple AirPods,elliet92,5,2024-07-14,"This is the airpod I like the most. I've been using this for several years now and it's still very good.

I also have Airpod (3rd generation) but I still prefer using this one. With a full charge, I can use it for many days."

"If you like apple earbuds, yes, otherwise there are other better fit brands",sebrinal3,3,2024-07-14,"It lasted quite a while, able to sufficiently use throughout the whole day without charging. The shape of the ear buds are not meant for smaller ear holes, and can fall out easily. The sound is amazing, able to get quiet enough, but too loud and others are easily able to hear."

2nd generation,jazmina140,3,2024-07-14,I am going to give these a 3 star because my AirPods did not last as long as I wanted it to. Both pods gave out eventually and never worked again. Sound quality was good but could be better. I was worried that the fit would be uncomfortable but it felt quite nice/snug in my ears.

Super comfortable,emilyr976,5,2024-07-13,So comfortable in my ears and the battery lasts forever!!!!!! The sound is like music to my ears!!! Fits like glove on the tinier ears! Would recommend to all my friends
Air pods work great,trenatyp,5,2024-07-13,"Sure! AirPods are known for their **comfort**, fitting snugly in the ears without causing discomfort during extended use. The **sound quality** is impressive, offering clear highs, balanced mids, and deep bass. In terms of **durability**, they are quite sturdy and can withstand everyday wear and tear, though they aren't completely invincible. **Battery life** is another strong point, with up to 5 hours of listening time on a single charge and over 24 hours with the charging case. The **fit** is generally secure, making them suitable for various activities, though it can vary depending on ear shape. Overall, AirPods provide a great balance of these key features."
Great Apple product at a great discount,,5,2024-07-13,"So far, so good!"
Easy to connect . Great size‚Ä¶  great price!!,Tell,5,2024-07-13,"These items are very nice. I did reviews for a couple of months being that I have other Bluetooth earbuds including the beats. I want something that went in my ear versus over the ear because I wear glasses. I will wear the over the year when I'm working out or heavy movement. As I said, I did research for months and I also did price comparison because I wanted to get the best value simply because every time you buy one apple product another one comes out a couple of months later the second generation which is not the latest generation had the best reviews so I got them. Walmart had the best price hands-down. I'm very pleased and I was able to do a curbside pick up which made it easy to order and pick up. That's why Walmart is my go to. These things are very cute and can be very slippery and I can see them getting lost in my purse or me shuffling around in my purse looking for them or if I come to a stop falling on the ground or floor of the car. I would recommend getting a case I got this case. It works perfectly , you can't beat the deal on these is Connect immediately I was done in 50 seconds"
Comfortable for wearing a long time,levlev,5,2024-07-13,"I purchased my first Apple AirPods with the charging case few years ago, and they are amazing! The sound quality is really good, and they are super easy to connect to my iPhone. The charging case is very handy because it keeps my AirPods charged during my work days or when I'm traveling. I love that they fit comfortably in my ears, even when I wear them for a long time. The battery life is great too. My first once worked for a bit over a year and my second one works for two years now without problems. Overall, I'm very happy with my AirPods and would highly recommend them to anyone looking for wireless comfy earbuds."
Not long lasting,petrar27,3,2024-07-13,They were nice but don't last long. Always needed to get them repaired and I didn't like that since they were very expensive. I used them daily for running and just not my favorite.
OK Headphones!,hannahb1029,3,2024-07-13,"These headphones are super comfortable and have great sound output. However, as they age, the period between charges gets dramatically cut, and you have to charge the case more frequently. Also, to hear anything, you have to increase the volume on your phone, which can damage your ears!"

You should get air pods because they are pocket size and connect able whenever you use them.,itsaniyah,4,2024-07-13,They are small enough to fit in you ear and pockets to travel. Apple air pods are comfortable and able to be used when ever and where ever you want. The sound quality is amazing. The battery lasts a long time and the charger doesnt take long to charge them.
"AirPods are worth the investment, and are very high quality.",,5,2024-07-13,"Amazing sound quality paired with a sleek design. Comfortable to wear, with a very impressive battery life. I've found my AirPods are very easily tracked if lost. Easily charged and haven't broken even when dropped."
"Good way to listen to music on run walk, etc.",agm17,5,2024-07-13,"I love the way the AirPods fit in your ear, not too loose where I like will fall out. Also, the battery once you charge it to fully charged it'll last for a while and the sound is really good. You can also cancel out other sound."

great headphones for listening to music and day to day tasks.,yunisdiary,4,2024-07-12,this product is great! the sound quality is amazing and they last a couple hours. they last long! my only complaint is some times they hurt my ears.
I really loved my Apple AirPods,brandonb153,4,2024-07-12,"I received brand new Apple Airpods from work as a gift. They worked great. The sound quality was perfect when playing music and videos and they charged quickly. I was able to take phone calls and was always heard loud and clear. However, If you have a wider opening of your ear canal, then sometimes they tend to slip out. This was my only dislike. They are perfect if you're stationary, like sitting at a desk, etc. I decided to sell them and buy powerbeats pros which wrap around the ear and are held in place. They have been perfect and extremely reliable."

Does Not Hold a Charge,brianduuuh,3,2024-07-12,Does not hold a charge long enough. I've also noticed it's not as loud. I should be able to determine the level of sound I enjoy.
"I have no regrets buying these AirPods and they are very useful for school, work, the gym, and more!",gracier68,4,2024-07-12,"I bought these AirPods due to their convenient looks and how good their price was. The durability was amazing, they could make it through anything and last for years. The battery life lasted for at least 2 days. They fit in my ear so comfortably, it feels like I have nothing in my ears. Along with these great perks is the sound quality. You are able to turn your volume up and hear it clearly without others having to hear it. These AirPods are one of the best things I have spent my money on and I suggest everyone tries them."
Good earphones that fit small ears,allyj39,5,2024-07-12,"I have small ears and have struggled with finding earphones that fit my ears, but, these earphones have fit perfectly.

"Great, but could be even better",douglasl5,4,2024-07-12,"Apple Airpods have set an industry standard when it comes to true wireless headphones, and that has given them a competitive advantage. I've loved pairing them with my apply products, but the Bluetooth pairing leaves something to be desired. The Find My feature and playing a sound also doesn't always work. Overall, they are good, but don't have amazing sound quality either."

Worth the price!,charityr30,5,2024-07-12,These are very convenient and easy to use. I can pair them with multiple devices.

Good for day to day,courtneyr324,4,2024-07-11,"I love these headphones and used them for a long time! The only downsides are if you're running, they may fall out of your ears. Otherwise they are so convenient to carry with you and the battery life is very good too."

Good but‚Ä¶,Daniel,5,2024-07-11,I really like the Apple AirPods. They connect to my Apple phone easily and have pretty good sound. But they fit my ears poorly and they fall out easily. I have noticed that many people have no problem using the AirPods so at least some of the problem is the shape of my ear.
Great product at a fantastic price!,Apryl,5,2024-07-11,These are the perfect earbuds! They are so light and comfortable!

Amazing Product.,heyitsanishs,4,2024-07-11,"The batterylife is alright, but the noise cancellation is everything with this product. I love it so much and it fits just right and is very comfortable and has great durability."

beats / actual headphones may be a better option's,sydney_russ,5,2024-07-11,"I love my AirPods- they're so comfortable, and fit AND stay inside my ears. Ive had one of them literally break apart when I dropped it, so the durability is questionable. Sound quality is great, but battery life deteriorates very quickly over time."
So practical!!,saraht768,5,2024-07-11,I love the apple airpods because of how small and practical they are. They easily fit in your pocket. Only downside is they can get uncomfortable and start to squeeze in my ear.

trash,alexk211,1,2024-07-11,"Overpriced and underwhelming. Sound quality disappoints, connection issues persist. Not worth the premium Apple price tag."

Convient but not enough longevity,toribb7d7,4,2024-07-11,"The audio quality these provide being wire free is worth it. The Bluetooth connection allows your phone to charge and have headphones in at the same time. If you can manage not to lose them after over a year of use, there is a notable decrease in battery longevity. After a while of frequent use, fully charged, the earbuds will not last very long. They feel similar to the wire ones in terms of fit, just the part that hangs down is thicker. The amount of times mine have been dropped and survived, I would say that are pretty durable. A case helps the airpod case from opening and then flying across the floor. There are so many different cases for AirPods that they can become an accessory."
,WalmartCustomer,5,2024-07-11,Great produce and great price
How can this item have so many good reviews?,Bettyboop,1,2024-07-11,These appear to be used or refurbished ones that were not cleaned. Buyer beware! Don't waste your money or time!

Not noise canceling,domininquem,5,2024-07-11,This product has good sounds quality the only down side is if you turn it all the way up people around you can hear it. They also are not noise canceling. Fit the ears great. And the battery life lasts up to a week.

Breaks out of nowhere,Rashaads,1,2024-07-11,Every time I buy these headphones they mysteriously stop connecting and one of the AirPods just stop working entirely. Apple has to be damaging these on purpose because they aren't worth paying for

"Cheap, stops connecting",Ashal,1,2024-07-10,"This is the second iPods I purchased. Compared with the original I purchased from Apple Store 6 months ago, these SUCK. They constantly disconnect from 15 pro max while on a call. Then auto reconnects. It's only linked to one device so it's not another Bluetooth connection problem. The taps don't work for volume control and it will just start playing from last media app randomly. Such a waste of time and money."

Airpods 5 stars!!! Walmart half a star!!!,kevin,1,2024-07-10,Communication from Wallmart did not exist. Still waiting for responses.

It's durable and has decent sound.,tweety333,4,2024-07-09,"This tends to fall out of my ears, I have to put a pair of silicon earbud tips on them. It has decent sound quality and I've had this for a long time already. I used them one at a time to extend the battery. So one is charging while I use the other one."
It's great,jimmyn12,4,2024-07-09,"Sound quality was great, battery lasts a while, and it's easy to understand. I'm impressed with how well it works and look forward to buying more products."

AirPods Pro: The Ultimate Earbuds Experience üéß,davidw190,5,2024-07-08,"If you haven't tried the AirPods Pro with the charging base yet, you're seriously missing out! These little guys are an absolute game-changer for daily life. I've been using them everywhere‚Äîfrom mowing the grass to chilling on the couch‚Äîand they've consistently delivered top-notch performance. **Pros:** - Noise Cancellation: The active noise cancellation is phenomenal. It's like flipping a switch to drown out the world and focus on your tunes or podcast. - Comfort: The fit is super snug, thanks to the customizable silicone tips. No more earbuds falling out during workouts! - Sound Quality: The sound is crisp and clear with a nice balance of bass and treble. Perfect for any music genre or audio preference. - Convenience: The charging base is a lifesaver. Just pop the AirPods back in, and they're juiced up in no time. Plus, the battery life is impressive, lasting up to 24 hours of use with the charging case. - Integration: Seamless integration with Apple devices is another huge win. Switching between my iPhone and MacBook is effortless. **Cons:** - Price: They are a bit on the pricey side, but you get what you pay for. The quality and features justify the cost, in my opinion. - Compatibility: While they do work with non-Apple devices, you don't get the same seamless experience. Compared to other earbuds on the market, the AirPods Pro stands out with its blend of sound quality, comfort, and ease of use. I've tried a few other brands, but nothing beats the overall package that Apple offers here. Whether you're a tech junkie or just someone looking for reliable, high-quality earbuds, the AirPods Pro is definitely worth the investment. Trust me, you won't regret it! ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê"

Quality and longevity,evanm50,5,2024-07-08,"I run equipment all day so I needed something that could hold up to rough use, drown out the loud equipment, and still be able to enjoy my music. These have excelled at all of these point.

Would highly recommend them."

The Best Wireless Headphones on the Market,salemg4,5,2024-07-08,"I currently have the second and third generation of Airpods and I love them. My favorite aspect is how quickly they connect to any of my Apple devices, and I can track them easily if lost. I love that they notify me if they get left behind so I never worry about losing them.

Best sound and convenient set of earbuds,hgovert,5,2024-07-06,Apple AirPods are the best purchase I have ever made. The sound is very clear and is the best I've heard out of a wireless earbud.

Great to start,marsh5,3,2024-07-06,These headphones are cute and they do the job but not the greatest. After a few months the day do begin to loose sound and are easy to break or loose. They also fall out constantly and hurt my hears when I wear them longer than 30 min
Daily use,colleenw,5,2024-07-06,I don't go a day without my AirPods. I wear them while listening to audio books and podcasts while doing chores / exercise. They stay put in the gym or on the run. Great battery life and sound quality.

LOVE THESE AIRPODS,sarar737,5,2024-07-05,I've had my airpods for about 4 years now and they still work amazing!! I use them everyday for workouts and focus time in the office. The battery life lasts me about a week and the sound quality is always great. Highly recommend these!
Great buy,Missy,5,2024-07-05,"These are literally second pair I have bought. My first pair I got two years ago on Black Friday for same price. My daughter took those and did not realize they were in her pocket and washed them. Both pods loose and the case. The pods I found in dryer and case separately in washer. But they literally still work, Best Buy for sure!! I bought new pair for myself !! Definitely good buy and for price!!"
Sometimes connection is flaky,kadmield,5,2024-07-05,"It's an Apple product. It just works. What can I say really? There's a variety of Bluetooth headphones out there by numerous brands. I already owned a pair of my own that, if I'm honest, we're fine. But the sound wasn't great and the connection sometimes a bit flaky. I finally took the plunge and, as per the title, they just work. Right out of the box, instantly connected, self labelling as 's AirPods."

Amazing product,alejosmarlen,5,2024-07-05,Comfortable and handy when I go on runs. Battery life is amazing I charge once every month and I use them every day. They are very durable and sound quality is amazing.
Great battery,shylars2,3,2024-07-05,The comfort fit hurt my ears if on the smaller side of the scale but they don't last as long my air pods pro did but does have excellent battery life and don't have to charge the headphones if you keep case charge and keep headphones in case when not in used
The New Standard These Days,donw11,4,2024-07-05,"The Apple Airpods are the headphones you see in basically everyone's ears around town and honestly it makes sense. The entry level Airpods are not terribly expensive, sound good, and if you're in the Apple ecosystem, just work with everything. My one complaint with them is I honestly don't find this version the most comfortable. I'm not sure if its my ear shape/size or the product but I prefer the ones with gel tips to the basic hard plastic. But in all honesty its not a deal breaker. This product is still effective and worth the price especially if you can get them on sale."
"The Apple AirPods with the charging case offer seamless connectivity, convenience, and impressive battery life in a sleek and minimalistic design.",arikat1,5,2024-07-05,"The Apple AirPods with the charging case are a popular choice for wireless earbuds. They offer seamless connectivity to Apple devices, thanks to the W1 chip, and provide good sound quality for everyday use. One of the standout features is their convenience - they automatically connect to your device when you take them out of the case and pause playback when removed from your ears. The battery life is also impressive, offering several hours of listening time on a single charge, with additional charges provided by the compact and portable charging case. In terms of design, they are sleek and minimalistic, fitting comfortably in most ears. However, some users may find that they don't fit securely during vigorous activities like running or working out. Overall, if you're deeply integrated into the Apple ecosystem and value ease-of-use and portability over audiophile-grade sound quality or customizable fit options for sports activities then these could be an excellent choice."
Very very good!,Anna,5,2024-07-05,"Awesome product! Just one thing to remember is that it isn't noise canceling, so if you want that get the pro airpods. Overall amazing, affordable product. Definitely worth the money!"
Careful to not drop them,jadee72,4,2024-07-05,Pretty good other than the magnets broke open when dropped but the sounds amazing and they work great for calling. Very comfortable when it comes to sleeping or just relaxing. And battery life can last a few days without having to charge.

Sometimes connection is flaky,kadmield,5,2024-07-05,"It's an Apple product. It just works. What can I say really? There's a variety of Bluetooth headphones out there by numerous brands. I already owned a pair of my own that, if I'm honest, we're fine. But the sound wasn't great and the connection sometimes a bit flaky. I finally took the plunge and, as per the title, they just work. Right out of the box, instantly connected, self labelling as 's AirPods."

Great Product!,kendallko,5,2024-07-03,"I got Airpods for a birthday present a few months ago. I wasn't sure how I felt about them at first because I know there are less expensive versions. But I quickly realized how much I actually enjoyed them. They really do cancel out noise effectively and they're easy to operate. There have been a few times when they haven't connected to a device quickly and/or easily. Once, one of the ear buds kept displaying a 0% charge when I had been charging it for hours and the other bud was completely charged. The ear buds also have fallen out of my ears several times, but I think that can be adjusted. Other than that, I've really enjoyed my AirPods and I use them more than I thought I would. I would definitely recommend them!"

Buy them,jonm52,5,2024-07-02,"I love my Airpod Pros, there hasn't been a time where they weren't clutch. Battery life is great, never broken, great bass as well as a comfortable fit in the ears."
Great product!,kiaraw30,5,2024-07-02,AirPods are some of my favorite headphones that I've tried. They are very durable and have good speakers. The only thing is that they can hurt your ears after awhile.
Long battery life and perfect fit for everyone.,xoxodrea,5,2024-07-02,One of my favorite apple products I own! I can always freely walk around school listening to music! :) These Airpods I own have lasted me years. I love them!
The BEST,destinyhunter01a3624,5,2024-07-02,These are literally weightless! These speakers hold a charge throughout my whole day! The sound quality is amazing! Very durable for falls/water spills!
Great buy! Highly recommend!,kyrsykao,5,2024-07-02,These AirPods are great! Amazing sound quality of the speakers. They last years! My only problem was they fit weird sometimes depending on the type of pods you get. The battery lasts for a very long time!

Old model but still is my favorite,kilareh,5,2024-07-02,"This one have been my go-to earphones for years, and they continue to impress. I love their stylish design, which is both sleek and functional. They fit comfortably in my ears, providing a secure and enjoyable listening experience. Sound quality is exceptional, delivering clear highs and deep bass that enhance any music genre or podcast. The battery life is outstanding; thanks to the charging case, I rarely worry about running out of power, even during long days. Their durability is remarkable too‚ÄîI've been using them for over five years, and they still perform like new. The AirPods' seamless integration with Apple devices and reliable Bluetooth connectivity make them a must-have for anyone looking for convenience and quality in wireless earphones."

It is great,sangl4,5,2024-07-02,The sound quality is great. Noise cancellation removes outside noises when I listen to music. Also I don't have to charge often each used compare to other products.
I love mine,suamyf,5,2024-07-02,"I'm obsessed with my AirPods!!! The sound quality and battery life are great. I'm so glad I caved in and bought them, I literally take them with me everywhere (since they're small) and use them so much, but mostly at the gym."
Great purchase,addiebellh,5,2024-07-02,These AirPods are my daily go to! I use them everywhere I go. They have a great battery life and sound quality. They are comfortable I can wear them all day long and never be uncomfortable they fit great!
Strongly Recommended!,kyunghak,5,2024-07-02,"Nice design, excellent sound quality, and very comfortable to wear. Absolutely love it!! It also lasts pretty long. Never worried about going out of battery."
Works better than the latest model,Crystal,5,2024-07-02,These AirPods work better then the other generations. I have brought multiple pair. Definitely a great steal when they go on sale.
Topnotch !!,agathaevelynbenjamin,5,2024-07-02,"The Apple AirPods have become a topnotch with wireless earbuds, offering a seamless blend of convenience, style, and performance. Here's why they continue to be a top choice for many people."
Works great,nsaneseal,5,2024-07-02,I've had for quite a bit and they have been having great battery life and work very well overall with eats as well as noise cancellation. The battery will sometimes last days.

using from 2019! still do the job great,kulsabina,5,2024-07-02,"I've used Apple AirPods since 2019, and they're fantastic. The sound is clear and rich, and they're very comfortable, even during workouts. Pairing with my devices is seamless. The battery life is great, and the noise cancellation works wonderfully. Highly recommended!"
"Instead of getting the wired headphones and the ones that hurt your ears, try these very simple and easy.",nailah5,5,2024-07-02,"Honestly, I love them. They charge up really fast and lasting many hours, they easily fit in your ear. They're very easy to carry. The sound is very nice and they don't hurt my ears. Ôøº"
Love,rosabug22,5,2024-07-02,"Love these so much better than other ear pieces I've tired. They definitely sound proof and they turn the music down when I'm talking to someone. The sounds is perfect intact, as good as the battery life last long"
Best fit for smaller ears,kl93,5,2024-07-02,"I have tried all apple airpod generations & this one WINS! Sound quality is great but not the best; however, I prefer these ones over the newer ones because they don't fall out of my ears. PERFECT FIT"
Great product,justinb4,5,2024-07-01,"I love my AirPods they are great. I wish the battery life in the head phones lasted longer than a few hours. They fit nice and snug in my ear, they are also comfortable. The sound is good too. I have dropped them multiple times and they are still going strong."
,WalmartCustomer,5,2024-07-01,Reliable product with good sound quality. Price is better than competitors.
Not keeping charge,Billie,2,2024-07-01,"Hard to connect to iPhone, sometimes don't register when charging, and not staying charged long. Would return but boyfriend works in steel mill and little dirty but makes do for work."
Love apple,kimr7,5,2024-07-01,I wish these were just a little more comfortable. I'm assuming most people think they are since so many walk around with them in their ears but I find that they make my ears sore after a short period of time. I like that they come with a few different size comfort rubber ear pieces. The life of the charge seems to last forever before needing to charge again. I appreciate the way it gives the battery charge life on the phone so it's easily viewed. Charging is simple and features a couple different methods since this is an apple product these are very compatible and easy to use on Apple TV for a big screen in your home. I love Apple products and love these pods but would like to see more in the lines of ear pieces for comfort.
,Valery,1,2024-07-01,"If I could give 0 stars I would, they do not work properly. Battery doesn't last, I have to charge the charging case every single day because the battery doesn't last and they just turn off instantly. Do not buy!"
Ok,Eddie,3,2024-07-01,They keep falling out my ear and the sound quality is not that great.
Quality ear buds in a sea of junk.,micahd9,5,2024-07-01,"We love our Apple AirPods, the kids use them to drown us out and we use them to drown out the kids. Lol! We've had the some sets for years now with now issues. The battery life is good, they are durable, and comfy."
Good purchase!,roses818,5,2024-07-01,Can't go wrong with Apple products. These are one of the best headphones in the market. I use these for phone calls or when I'm working out at the gym for music. It's comfortable enough to work out with and the sound quality is pretty good. Lasts hours on a full charge.
,WalmartCustomer,5,2024-07-01,Reliable product with good sound quality. Price is better than competitors.
Decent but has its flaws,teahouse,3,2024-07-01,"These do not fit in individuals ears if they have smaller ear hole opening. It doesnt come with adjustable rubber nibs. I find that it falls out of my ears a lot. another thing is is, sometimes the noise cancellation works, sometimes it comes in really low and can't hear very well what other person is saying. other than that it's compact, has a small case, charges fast, and has all these cute case covers."
The best in the market.,reeses33,5,2024-07-01,"Although it may be the name brand,what I have found are Apple AirPods are the most reliable product on the market with a built in AirTag for tracking purposes and a wireless connection the product is not popular for nothing,they're perfect for travel and stay connected within a 15 foot range,unlike other cord free headphones I've tried."

Really good and outstanding,davidm516,4,2024-07-01,"If you prioritize noise cancellation and a custom fit, the air pods are a great option.

Very comfortable and worth the buy!,adisonc3,5,2024-07-01,10/10!! Great for absolutely anything even for working out. Super comfortable for the ear and stay in contact. The sound quality is great and can't hear from outside. The battery life is also great! Can go days without charging.

The sound and the design.,mirlandej,4,2024-07-01,"I love the great invention, the good quality and very comfortable for everyone's ear, the excellent sound. The battery life lasts forever and I rarely need to recharge it. I love the Apple AirPod, it's perfect, it's my favorite. I would recommend this so if you're person who enjoys music, I think they are excellent the hearing pods even for the price to begin with there are quite expensive headphones for most people but the convenience of the Apple AirPods is amazing the wireless design makes them super easy to use and carry around comfortably. And then basically you can't go wrong with these they seamlessly connect to your iPhone and will connect to any other Bluetooth device with a few extra steps. In my case, I practically don't take them off at work and in the car because my ears never get tired of them. Sometimes I forget that they are in my ears. Apple Watch + iPhone + AirPods - a wildly comfortable combination when you're running around at work, driving, or exercising, basically in situations where it's not always convenient to hold your phone. You just need to tell the watch who to call, the sound switches to the headphones, and you start the conversation without taking the phone out of your pocket/bag/jacket.The headphones work autonomously with the watch, you can leave your phone at home or in the storage box when you go to the gym. The convenient and compact storage case also serves as a charging device. Its capacity is enough for 6-9 headphone charges. Considering that I use the headphones for 5-8 hours a day, I charge the case 1-2 times a week."
Defective,Fran,1,2024-06-30,The iPod don't stay charge they are defective
Will buy again!,jennifera911,5,2024-06-30,I literally love these so much!! I actually prefer them than the other versions because they never fall out of my ears! The sound quality is always good and the battery life is so worth it!
I really enjoy them. The music is awesome through these.,salinaw2,5,2024-06-30,I like these over other headphones because that the quality the battery light the durability like it's comfortable in my ears. It don't hurt it just fits the sound most of them that I've had. I could only listen to music through one and the other one wouldn't do nothing and these both of them play so it's really good.

The Apple AirPods have completely stop charging,Tonta,1,2024-06-30,They stop working I haven't even had them a month yet
Ehh.,thedavil,2,2024-06-30,These AirPods in particular do not like to stay in your ear unless you want to fumble around with some slip on silicone earbud covers.. the ones I have won't go back into the charging case unless I remove the slip on covers. I almost lose them every day. And the case where the lid magnetizes shut gets this weird dark stains along the lid lining. It's not anything that can be gotten rid of & it's not dirt or anything gross.. it's frustrating! Also I wish these got louder without sounding borderline blown. My AirPods last a couple hours before the light turns red / they need charged. Btw . It's sooooo easy to lose pieces of these. Unfortunately I would never re purchase this exact type of AirPod.
very good,vanv18,5,2024-06-29,"They are perfect for my work conference calls that I have weekly and for listening to podcasts and audiobooks not the most expensive or high-tech, but they are perfect for what I use them for."
"These are good for the gym, sports,and even just at home!",joslynl10,5,2024-06-29,Yes they are very helpful for working and you just want to listen to music. I personally use them everywhere I go! But it also shows and tells you your notifications. I definitely recommend
Apple air pods,Lisa,5,2024-06-29,Wonderful purchase Walmart delivered fast and reliable
Perfect bo,harlena,5,2024-06-29,Had mine for 3 years before i decided to replace them to try something new but i still miss them and truly hope anyone who orders knows they are the best. For me the fitting in my ears was never a problem as well always had crisp sound with good bass
"Good, for a while.",charliep50,4,2024-06-29,"I really liked my apple airpods, although, after a couple of years, they start to sound really grainy and loose their ability to keep a charge for long periods of time, which I guess is to be expected of any piece of technology. I wish these came equipped with noise cancellation, like the newer generations and models do, but they don't. The volume turns up pretty loud and the self-chosen buttons on the sides of the ear pieces are really nice and convenient. My biggest problem with these earbuds is that they don't like to stay in the ear, they like to slip out, especially if you have smaller ears or ears that get pretty oily or waxy. Other than that, the apple airpods are a pretty decent, basic bluetooth earbud that are convenient for apple users."
Portable,zoeyw31,5,2024-06-29,"These are great for listening to music at home or on the go, they're subtle. The downside is they're easy to lose and fall out easily. The fit well and have a good battery life"
"They are so comfortable , affordable and great for every occasion",andreac1210,5,2024-06-29,I give these AirPods 5 stars. They are so durable I have dropped them in the toilet or in water so many times and they are still working amazing . I highly recommend!!!! The battery life is so good I last hours without charging my AirPod and my case it lasts days maybe a week without charge!
Great sound quality in a convenient charging case and long battery life,colee4,5,2024-06-29,"I love these headphones. The battery life is tremendous. They don't fall out of my ears, they provide hours of comfort listening and ease of use. I love being able to control music with the clicks on the bottom. I am impressed with the Bluetooth range and the sound quality. These are my go to for workouts as well. Only minor improvement could be noise cancellation."

"Comfortable, compact, and surprisingly durable",asphodelr,4,2024-06-29,"I've had my airpods for around three years now and I have very few complaints about them. Pretty comfortable, even when laying down. The sound quality is nice, I honestly prefer it to my headphones. The case is battered but that's mainly due to surviving two puppies teething phase. My one possible complaint would be that it's hard to wear them while moving or working out without worrying about them falling out, but that's pretty minor in the grand scheme of things."

I was also pleasantly surprised by the battery life; they easily last me through a full day of listening and calls without needing a recharge. The design is sleek and minimalist, fitting comfortably in my ears without feeling bulky or obtrusive. I appreciate the convenience of the touch controls, which allow me to play/pause music or answer calls with a simple tap. The case itself is compact and holds multiple charges, making it perfect for travel or long commutes. Overall, the Apple AirPods have exceeded my expectations in terms of performance, comfort, and ease of use. They've become an essential part of my daily routine, and I highly recommend them to anyone looking for a reliable and high-quality wireless earbud option."

Easy to use and great sound!,graceg310,5,2024-06-20,"I've been using these wireless earbuds for a while now, and they've quickly become a daily essential. The design is sleek and minimalist, though I'm not a fan of the stem that pokes out of my ears. They're lightweight and comfortable for long use, and the compact charging case is very convenient. The sound quality is impressive with clear highs and balanced mids, though the bass isn't as deep as over-ear headphones. The Active Noise Cancellation is excellent, making them great for noisy environments. The seamless integration with my Apple devices is a standout feature. Pairing is instant, and switching between my iPhone, iPad, and MacBook is effortless. The stable Bluetooth connection and automatic ear detection are big pluses. Battery life is solid with around 5 hours of listening time and up to 24 hours with the charging case. The Pro version offers slightly less listening time due to ANC but is still respectable. Very durable as well! Overall, these wireless earbuds have exceeded my expectations, despite the minor issue with the stem design."

Not worth the price.,bhavanim1,3,2024-06-17,I have used both air pods 1 and 3. Both of them worked fine for a while but started having issues after a year of use. Even after multiple attempts to troubleshoot they did not work. I would not recommend them considering the high price tag. There much better options for bluetooth earphones at more affordable prices.

Perfect Pairing with Apple devices,amalies16,5,2024-06-17,I love how seamlessly I can switch them from a phone call on my iPhone to a show on my computer. I also found the microphone very good for video conferencing. I did a training with young children in the next room over and the AirPods did a great job of picking up my speech while not picking up all the background noise.
Not satisfied,sarvenazh,2,2024-06-17,It has an average battery life. It doesn't fit all the ear shapes and mine keeps falling out of my ears. It's not that comfortable. It sometimes cause irritation in the ears.

Overrated big time,caseyt67,3,2024-06-17,"They get lost all the time. Design is pretty bad and there isn't a great tracking system if uou lose one (like a way to make it beep or light up a la search my phone). I read an article recently also where the creators has literally said that airpods weren't meant to last more than a year or two. That explains why my step son has gone through 3 pairs in the last few years already. The fit isn't great for my ears, so I have to buy additional inserts. The battery life and sound quality are fine but I would rather a normal pair of headphones or wired ones that actually plug into my phone over the airpods any day."

Helpful in my life,martak5,5,2024-06-16,"#### Design and Comfort Apple AirPods maintain the sleek and minimalist design typical of Apple products. The lightweight earbuds fit comfortably in most ears, and their design allows for prolonged use without significant discomfort. The lack of cables is liberating, making them ideal for on-the-go use. #### Sound Quality The sound quality of AirPods is impressive for their size. They offer clear and balanced audio, with crisp highs and adequate bass. While they may not satisfy audiophiles seeking deep bass or intricate soundstage, they perform well for everyday listening, including music, podcasts, and calls. #### Connectivity AirPods excel in connectivity, thanks to the H1 chip that enables seamless pairing with Apple devices. The connection is generally stable, and switching between devices within the Apple ecosystem is almost effortless. The range is also commendable, allowing for a reliable connection even when away from the paired device. #### Features - **Siri Integration**: Hands-free ""Hey Siri"" functionality adds convenience. - **Automatic Ear Detection**: Playback pauses when an AirPod is removed and resumes when it is reinserted. - **Touch Controls**: These allow for simple control over playback and calls, though they can be a bit sensitive. #### Battery Life The AirPods themselves offer about 5 hours of listening time or 3 hours of talk time on a single charge. The charging case provides multiple additional charges, extending total usage time to over 24 hours. The case itself charges quickly via a Lightning cable, though it lacks wireless charging capabilities unless you opt for the Wireless Charging Case variant. #### Call Quality Call quality is strong, with dual beamforming microphones that reduce background noise and ensure your voice comes through clearly. This makes AirPods a reliable choice for both personal and professional calls. #### Portability The compact charging case is highly portable and easily fits into a pocket or small bag. The magnetic closure ensures the AirPods stay secure and charged while not in use."

"A MUST have, worth my $$$",alicel155,4,2024-06-15,"Apple products don't always have the best rep, so I was concerned when the newer generations of airpods came out that my airpods from 2020 would eventually stop working. I can happily say that to this day they still work perfectly fine. They ARE definitely hard to track if you lose them but after attaching an apple airtag keychain to my Airpods Case I've had a lot more peace of mind. The audio on phone calls do make me sound like I'm underwater but that's a small price to pay for something I use daily. If you're thinking about buying these, DO IT!"
,WalmartCustomer,5,2024-06-15,"Because it arrived in perfect condition and arrived on time, I really liked that it arrived on time and they treated it delicately and very good service 10/10"
"Good for some, overpriced for value",mahitas,3,2024-06-15,"These are amazing when they actually work. The sound quality deteriorates after a couple months of mild use, and eventually one airpod plays significantly quieter than the other. Keep in mind that this is with extremely sporadic usage, low volume, and regular cleaning. Another issue I've faced is that the airpods don't conform properly to certain ear shapes, including mine. I've met people who don't have this issue, so it might just be dependent on what kind of ear shape you have. In my experience, I'm constantly needing to adjust my airpods, or else they pop out of my ears. This can b pretty frustrating, especially when I try to use them during more intensive activities (like jogging). It's also the main reason that I don't use them much. Overall, they're a great concept and are extremely convenient and versatile when they do actually work properly and fit you right."

They are OK,marias1636,3,2024-06-11,"They are OK, sounds is ok and they have good battery. They are comfortable enough but I wouldn't wear them for running or high impact sports. It pairs well with iPhone, but after few months of using them there are sometimes when one of the buds won't charge properly. I need to play around with it until it charges."

The convenience of true wireless earbuds can't be beat no more tangled cords or lost earbuds. The charging case is genius, giving me extra battery life on-the-go. I love how seamless the pairing process is, and the battery life is impressive. Whether I'm listening to music, taking calls, or using Siri, these AirPods deliver. The design is sleek and comfortable, and the additional features like spatial audio and water resistance make them a great investment. Overall, I'm so impressed with the innovation, design, and performance of Apple AirPods they're a must have accessory for any Apple fan!"
Not impressed,,2,2024-06-11,I bought these for work when I am at a desk. The left bud immediately went out. I took it to get fixed but it happened again to the same bud. Charge was not bad but they hurt my ears and would always fall out.

"Great sound quality, but hurts ears",oliviaw381,4,2024-06-11,"The sound quality was such an upgrade from previous earbuds. I loved the convenience of these. However, my only complaint is it caused pain in my ears"
Introvert Friendly Gadget!,lacyn13,5,2024-06-11,Sound quality is the best. Battery life lasts for a long time. It feels comfortable as long as you take it off from time to time to let your ears relax. Durability is highly convenient for both the youngsters and elderlies. The connection to the phone is also easy to use.
2 ordered 1 received,sabrina,1,2024-06-11,"Very disappointed to have only received one pair of Airpods, when I purchased 2. Walmart would not refund me or issue me a replacement, because there was a picture of the package on my porch. But it did not contain 2 pairs! I was made to feel like a liar and finally gave up, with all the run-around they gave me. It's just wrong!"
Love these!,sergiliat1,5,2024-06-11,I had been using them for over 2 years and they still work decently. They last me on average about 7 hours. The sound quality is still nice even after i accidentally dropped them in water.

"Good, there are better options out there",abbyb367,3,2024-06-11,Mine worked for about 5 years before the left one would no longer play music or connect to my device. The comfort was really nice as my ears are very sensitive and the sound quality always surprised me. I'd give the battery life about a 7/10.

Great quality but not waterproof,milas19,5,2024-06-10,I absolutely loved my Apple AirPods. They are very comfortable and I didn't have any problems with them falling out of my ears. The sound quality was absolutely perfect. Unfortunately they were not waterproof and my baby got a hold of them and put them in her mouth. I'm guessing the moisture shorted them out and they no longer charge.

Useful for on the go and comfort,alexap173,4,2024-06-10,AirPods are definitely an amazing invention. Great investment too.

Love my AirPods,sarag756,5,2024-06-10,I use my AirPods every day. They connect to my phone or laptop easily and I like how these feel in my ears as opposed to the newer generations with the soft tips. I have had these for years and never any issues.

Great for apple products,peterr47,5,2024-06-09,"The AirPods are the absolute choice if you were an apple product owner. It shifts effortlessly between my iMac, iPad and iPhone.

Awesome Apple product,Jack,4,2024-06-09,"So far, the product quality wise is great. Sound, design, and everything. The downside I see so far is that they're a little weird to put in. Like you have to turn the AirPods bottom tip a little upward in order to fit them properly. Other than that, they're great, and will last if taken care of properly. Highly recommend them."
Works great with Samsung phones,candir6,5,2024-06-09,"These are great! They even work on Android phones!! My husband and i both have Samsung Galaxy phones from different generations and they work great. The only thing different from an iPhone is that I had to download an app from the app store to track the battery life, which is no big deal to me. The sound is awesome, and they hold their charge. I find them very comfortable to wear, I have even slept with them, and I'm a side sleeper."

"Shaped nicely, great sound quality, easy to pack and go",kassidyh14,5,2024-06-08,I have always loved Apple products. This product I love a lot more because of how the pods themselves are shaped. They fit perfectly in my ears. The charging case is so simple to pull in and the change last a very long time. I barely have to pull my AirPods in. The options of also having the noise cancellation is a great feature as while.

"I highly suggest buying Apple AirPods, the quality and comfort is worth the price!",kailaxjoyy,5,2024-06-08,"I have had my Apple air pods for 5 years and they still work like brand new! The battery life for AirPods of 5 years is really nice!! Apple air pods are probably one of the comfiest in ear headphones I've ever worn, I have super sensitive ears so that is a total win! The sound quality has never gone down."

Do not get them wet!!,caitlynnc14,5,2024-06-07,"I love the apple headphones! They sounds great, they come out clear and they are loud! I would highly recommend these verses any other headphones! Would compare them with beats! The battery life is also something to brag about! They last hours!"

Very good headphone convenience is unsurpassable!,jordanp102,5,2024-06-07,Have used these for 8 years and I still love them. Could use and upgrade but ‚Äúif it isn't broke don't fix it‚Äù right!?! These are phenomenal headphones.
They're okay,macarior,4,2024-06-07,Unpopular opinion. These are just okay . They work fine but are uncomfortable in my honest opinion . They slip out also when sweating . Not the best design.
Not long lasting,deepakr1,4,2024-06-07,"I like its compatibility with iphone and how easy it is to connect to any apple device but the downside is its not long lasting, just 2 months into using it and the right ear-piece mic stopped working. If i just put the right earpiece the other person on the call would not hear anything. Also feature that comes with airpod pro called ""left behind"" doesn't come with this one. I feel with few $$ one should get airpod pro."

Isn't it harmful to health?,farangizk1,4,2024-06-07,I really like the product because it is compact and convenient and it lasts me for 4 days. comfortable to carry. I'm also a mom on maternity leave and this product is important to me because when the baby is sleeping I like that I can listen to music in peace.
You need these AirPods,vivianae16,5,2024-06-07,I love these Airpods very comfortable and last very long! The sound on them is great and super easy to set up. My son uses them for whenever we're out or wants to watch videos on his IPad
Best AirPods,amandac2715,5,2024-06-07,I bought these in 2021 not only do they still work they are awesome . Not one ear piece if broken. They battery life lasts for days! The quality is sick would give a 100/10
Great!,Tahyra,5,2024-06-07,Favorite thing to get from Walmart works perfectly!
Amazing and a must buy!,taniship,5,2024-06-07,I loved the fact that this product allowed me to almost fade away the whole world. The music quality is always amazing and it helps me better focus on my tasks by being able to focus while working. I was able to use my first gen airpods for almost three and a half year but after I bought the new gen. I would recommend to anyone who loves to work while being entertained while being able to focus. One thing I wish I knew before hand is that you could connect to several devices at one time. Growing up we were an android family so we always used amazon wireless headphones (which in most cases could only connect to one device) however I was fascinated by these. Also I did not know this but airpods are completely water proof. I learnt that the more stressful way :)
airpods,madysonh19,5,2024-06-07,"Amazing quality, I use them every day during various tasks such as school work, yard work, and house work. I appreciate them everyday, and I use them every single day."
Great earphones that exceeds your expectations.,bryang18,5,2024-06-07,I love my AirPods Pro and cannot wait to get the latest generation. The sound quality is amazing since everything sounds very clear. I love the noise cancellation feature as well as the adjustments that can be done based on your hearing in each year. It automatically connects to your iPhone once you you pair it as well as any other Apple devices.

Great for the office,breabankston,3,2024-06-07,"Love the sleek design, but this specific design apple offers seems to hurt my ears. The sound is great along with the battery life. I also love how it shows the battery life percentage on your phone once connected."

Easy to use,allied52,5,2024-06-04,"I like that these AirPods pair easily with all my devices. They seem to last forever, I've have these for over 3 years now. I'm not a big fan of the new pro version because I think these are more comfortable."

I also appreciate how easily they connect to my iPhone and other Apple devices. The AirPods Pro have active noise cancellation, which is very useful in noisy places.

I've only had rubber tip earbuds before and they always fall out so I needed the older model AirPods to fit in my ears. Only thing is I wish they had active noise canceling, or passive noise canceling? I don't know, just wish they had noise canceling. Although I guess the twos have noise canceling, it is a different shape though so I'm not sure if they would stay put in my ears.Ôøº"

Easy to use,jonathano39,5,2024-06-03,"The Apple AirPods and charging case, are easy to use with having the ease of not only worrying about wires being tangled due to the earbuds itself being wireless. You also have the ability to check the battery life for each earbud along with the case, but you don't have to worry about having to need a different charging cable since it's the same type as your iPhone. Sound quality is impressive with it having many options of sound qualities along with noise cancellation."

"Apple fan, AirPods‚Ä¶not so much",wendyf127,2,2024-06-02,"I am a fan of Apple products, I have an iPhone, 3 iPads, and a MacBook. Due to this, I got a pair of AirPods, and I was really disappointed. For an Apple product I expected more‚Ä¶better sound, better fit, better Bluetooth connection, just better everything. Let's start with the good: battery life, Single ear use, The sound of these headphones is ok. Not a lot of variability based on music choice. The sound is very flat. My biggest issue with AirPods is that they do not stay in the ear. Every time I move my head they fall out, as a matter of fact, I don't even have to move my head and they fall out. I was constantly worried about losing an AirPod. Lastly, the Bluetooth connection I find to be unstable. I constantly have to reconnect my AirPods to my device to get them to work. If o don't use my AirPods daily I have to reconnect. Also as I keep my devices updated, after every update I am having to reconnect the Bluetooth."
Sounds good and Reliable,clement,4,2024-06-02,"These fit my ears very well, very comfortable. After pairing for the first time, it automatically turned on when I put it in my ear. The sound quality is amazing and even though I've dropped them many times, they still work well. Total listening time is more than 24 hours with Charging Case. I really like them but I think the price is too high."
Quick and easy to use,tattedtim,4,2024-06-02,These earphones are pretty reliable for the first year or 2 but after that they start to quickly decline is audio quality and the headphones start to die and not function properly after having them for a while. Other than that they're durable and satisfying to use.
It's a good product,erickaw27,4,2024-06-02,Love the durability and the sound quality battery Life is OK. The comfort in the ear is OK as well. It doesn't stay all the way. Has the best connectivity!
Long battery life and are very comfortable,annabellej18,5,2024-06-02,I only charge my AirPods maybe once a month which is very useful for me. They fit nicely in my ears and don't fall out. I love my AirPods and the sound quality.

Really good basic headphones for ay daily activities!,jashere,5,2024-05-29,I have owned these AirPods for two years and not once have they broken. I have dropped them before which is where the dents come from but they are still fine and have great sound quality. They are extremely comfortable and you don't even notice them in your ears. They connect to your iPhone easily but I don't think you could use these with different devices that aren't Apple. The battery is just fine also. I love working out with these!
Best I've ever owned,selenan10,5,2024-05-29,"Great sound quality, batteries are good but I love using them when I'm working so I wish it lasted a little longer for those extremely long days.

Apple AirPods are a must,ceciliah57,5,2024-05-28,"I absolutely love these Apple AirPods. They are incredibly small and compact for travel or just day to day life.

The sleek and modern design of the earbuds is simply stunning, and they fit perfectly in my ears without any discomfort. Everyone could benefit from having a pair of Apple Airpods.

After a simple one tap setup, your AirPods are automatically on and always connected. They can sense when they are in your ears and can pause when you take them out. Sound can seamlessly switch between your iPhone, Apple Watch, iPad, or even your Apple TV. The sound quality is absolutely exceptional and makes for a great way to listen to music and podcasts daily. AirPods are more than just headphones, they are a part of my daily experience and they make my life easier and bring pleasure to listening to music or a podcast and talking on my phone. . They can make the perfect gift for anyone who appreciates superior sound quality, comfort, and ease of use."

I most definitely recommend this version over the newer ones!"

"Like the air pods, hate the case",alyssab598,2,2024-05-28,"Maybe I'm not super tech savvy but my case will always charge my AirPods even if I only used them for a couple minutes for a call and I have tried turning it off but it won't. My case for whatever reason also only charges the right side 100% but the left will be 96% it's not too much off but not sure why it does that. Other than that the sound quality is good, not great. Definitely not worth the price."

No wires. No complications. Pure magic. AirPods ar,zvarychv,5,2024-05-27,"No wires. No complications. Pure magic. AirPods are changing the way you use headphones. When you take AirPods out of the case, they immediately connect to your iPhone, Apple Watch, iPad, or Mac. Audio playback starts automatically as soon as you put the headphones on and stops when you take them off. Double-tap the earpiece to use Siri to change the volume, make a call, or even get directions. AirPods use a W1 chip specially designed by Apple, as well as optical sensors and an accelerometer ‚Äî thanks to their joint work, the headphones understand when you put them on. Depending on whether you use one or two headphones, the W1 chip automatically distributes the audio and turns on the microphone accordingly. And when you talk on the phone or use Siri, an additional accelerometer and microphones with variable directional pattern remove external noise and ensure a clear sound of your voice. AirPods with a super-economical W1 chip efficiently consume battery power and allow you to listen to music for 5 hours without recharging. And with a wireless charging case that provides several additional charging cycles, they can work for more than 24 hours. Need a quick recharge? Just 15 minutes of charging in the case allows you to listen to music for another 3 hours."

Good for a basic pair of ear buds,britt123,3,2024-05-22,"These AirPods certainly get the job done. I appreciate the noise cancellation, and how easy it is for me to hear when I have them in. That being said they don't hold a charge for very long. I can use them for about one hour before I need to have them charged again, which seems like a very short amount of time. And sometimes they don't connect to my phone as seamlessly as they should and sometimes they connect to the wrong device although I'm not sure how that happens because I only ever set them up with my phone.Ôøº"

Nice Airpod.,agustinaca,5,2024-05-22,"Love the sound and quality. It is amazing how well done are made. The battery life is about 6 hs running all day. They are really confortable to wear them . And they are easy to recharge with the usb cable. The only cons is that they doesn't come with a pocket for hung the case in your backpack. And if you lose 1 you cannot find it as they have tracking for both together in the case. Also if the battery is gone, forget it. You will never more will find them."

"The Apple AirPods with their charging case are a convenient, high-quality option for Apple users looking for a seamless, wireless audio experience.",melc64,4,2024-05-21,"They excel in ease of use, integration with Apple devices, and portability. While the sound quality is solid for general use, those seeking superior audio fidelity or active noise cancellation might consider other options like the AirPods Pro or over-ear headphones. The main drawbacks are the fit, which may not be perfect for everyone, and the lack of active noise cancellation in the standard model."
make sure you keep them charged for daily use.,laurieg62,5,2024-05-21,"I am an avid walker, the apple ipods keep a charge, are comfortable and have great sound quality. Also are very durable. Small enough to carry them for trips."

Great,christelleb78,5,2024-05-20,I really love the fact that they are small and compact . You can bring he everywhere with you without the trouble of it being bulky.. plus the music is good
"Great sound, Comfortable and reliable earbuds!",abbeym80,5,2024-05-20,These are some of the best sounding headphones I've ever used (and I've tried many). I am pretty picky when it comes to how things sound and most lack in some way. They're comfortable and easy to wear/operate. They do not fall out of my ears (I prefer these over the ones with the tips). The battery usually last me a pretty good while (6-7hrs continuously used) before having to put them back in the case- they charge really fast too. About ten minutes they're back to 80% or so. I can charge the buds a few times before I have to charge the case again.. so I never really go without being able to use my buds. I work 12 hour shifts and they last the entire shift and then some. They connect so effortlessly to anything that I choose. I've even dropped them in water (got them out and dried them really well) before and they still work perfectly. I definitely recommend!
They are truly a great product,matthewg90,5,2024-05-20,The sound quality on Apple AirPods are quite amazing. The battery life on mine tend to last multiple hours. The comfortable and durable design makes them a must buy.

Great product at a nice price.,Dennis,5,2024-05-18,"I'm an Apple product person and I've been looking for a deal on AirPods. They were so easy to connect to my iPhone and use with my iTunes app. The only problem that I am having is that the right pod doesn't stay in my ear for long, but it's no big deal because I don't walk around with them. There are probably some type of rubber grips that can make then tighter in the ears but my use doesn't require that right now.I just use them when I lay in bed and listen to music. The price at Walmart was significantly less than buying them from either Amazon or directly from Apple and there was no delivery fee or wait time. They were in stock at my local store."

It is definitely more comfortable to wear in the ear.,mervek14,5,2024-05-17,"The Apple AirPods (2nd generation) offer a familiar design with notable internal upgrades. They feature the H1 chip, which improves connectivity and allows for hands-free ""Hey Siri"" functionality. Sound quality is decent, suitable for casual listening, but lacks the bass and noise isolation found in higher-end models. Battery life is solid, providing around 5 hours of listening time and up to 24 hours with the charging case. While ideal for iPhone users due to seamless integration, they have limited on-device controls and no noise cancellation"

"Good headphones, highly recommended",juanc166,5,2024-05-16,"1. Very comfortable fit to the ear. You can easily engage in any active actions without fear that the headphones will fall out of your ear. Despite the fact that these are in-ear headphones, you get used to them quickly enough and they do not cause a feeling of discomfort. 2. Sound quality. The sound quality itself, I think, is at a high level. Of course, it always matters what to compare with, but at this price point and with all the features that they have, it's worthy. 3. Battery Life My headphones, given that I actively use them, after a year and a half, they still hold their charge perfectly. Until now, there was no moment that they would just sit down with me, I always manage to control it. Considering that you see the battery status almost every time you connect to the phone."

Apple AirPods - A Convenient Companion with Room for Improvement üéß,mikaylada1,4,2024-05-14,"Apple AirPods are undeniably convenient, but their performance in certain areas leaves something to be desired. While I've enjoyed using them, there are a few aspects worth noting. First, let's talk about the positives. The AirPods are incredibly convenient, especially for Apple users. The seamless pairing process, automatic connection, and integration with Siri make them a joy to use. They're lightweight, comfortable, and perfect for on-the-go use. However, when it comes to noise cancellation, the AirPods fall short of expectations. External noise can easily seep in, which can be frustrating, especially in noisy environments. For those seeking a more immersive listening experience, this could be a deal-breaker. Additionally, the battery life, while decent, isn't anything to write home about. While the case provides additional charging, I've found myself needing to recharge the AirPods more frequently than I'd like, especially during long days or travel. That being said, despite these shortcomings, I still find myself reaching for my AirPods regularly. Their convenience and integration with the Apple ecosystem outweigh their flaws. For casual listening and everyday use, they get the job done."
"Amazing, comfortable, great quality ear buds!",aliciah295,5,2024-05-14,I absolutely LOVE these headphones!! You can use one at a time so you can still hear the environment around you or both together!! The case actually charges the AirPods and one charge in the case lasts me 2 weeks or more! The sound quality is amazing and they're conveniently sized so you can toss anywhere without adding bulk! It's nice the case uses the same charger as my phone so I'm not lugging around multiple cords! I use these all the time for meetings at work too without issues! I have smaller ears and these are the only ear buds that don't cause discomfort or fall out! Get some! They're worth the investment! I have had mine for YEARS!
Great headphones!,caitm6,4,2024-05-14,"I love these headphones! The sound quality is really good and they're so convenient and portable. The battery life last a really long time and it's so handy that they use the same charger as an iPhone. The only downside is that sometimes when you put them into the charging case, one or the other may not fully connect and may not charge."

"In summary, AirPods are a must-have for anyone looking for top-notch wireless earbuds.",hermannv,5,2024-05-12,"The AirPods are a game-changer! The sound quality is impressive, and the convenience of wireless connectivity is unmatched. The sleek design and seamless integration with Apple devices make them a must-have for on-the-go music lovers. Charging is a breeze with the case, and the battery life is excellent. A top-notch choice for anyone looking for quality wireless earbuds."
Classic AirPods 1st Gen: Pioneering Convenience with a Few Misses,lanndob,3,2024-05-12,"When Apple first introduced the AirPods 1st generation, they set the stage for a new era of wireless audio, combining sleek design with some groundbreaking features. While they have since been eclipsed by more advanced models, the original AirPods still hold a significant place in the evolution of true wireless earbuds. **Design and Comfort:** The design of the AirPods 1st generation is minimalistic and iconic. Their stem-like structure, which protrudes from the ear, is now universally recognized. Made primarily of glossy white plastic, they are lightweight and comfortable for prolonged use, fitting securely in most ear types without the need for ear tips. However, the one-size-fits-all approach can be a downside for users with smaller or larger ears, leading to potential discomfort or poor fit. **Sound Quality:** Audio quality on the AirPods 1st generation is decent but not exceptional. They offer a balanced sound profile with reasonable clarity and an emphasis on mid-range frequencies, which makes vocals stand out. However, they lack bass response and sound isolation due to the absence of in-ear sealing. This design choice means they are not ideal for noisy environments, as a significant amount of ambient sound penetrates the earbuds. **Connectivity and Battery Life:** One of the strongest points of the AirPods 1st generation is the seamless integration with Apple devices, powered by the custom-designed W1 chip. This chip ensures a stable connection and allows for quick pairing with an iPhone or iPad. Switching between devices is relatively smooth, thanks to iCloud sync, though it's not as instantaneous as later models with the newer H1 chip. Battery life, however, is a weak spot. The earbuds themselves offer only about 5 hours of listening time, and although the charging case provides multiple charges, total listening time is less compared to newer models. **Functionality and Features:** The lack of certain features like tap controls for volume or the absence of sweat and water resistance makes the 1st generation AirPods less versatile compared to newer generations. They do, however, support double-tap gestures to trigger Siri, play or pause audio, which feels intuitive and handy. **Conclusion:** The AirPods 1st generation are a testament to Apple's focus on design and seamless user experience. While they revolutionized the wireless earbud market with their release, by today's standards, they fall short in areas like battery life, sound isolation, and audio performance. For those heavily embedded in the Apple ecosystem and looking for basic wireless earbuds, the AirPods 1st generation might still be appealing. However, for users seeking more robust features and superior sound quality, looking into the newer models or alternative brands might be advisable. Overall, the AirPods 1st generation earns a solid 3.5 out of 5 stars, primarily for their impact on wireless audio technology and user-friendly design."

the headphones do not fall out of my ears even during a trainig )))))))),nataliiak18,5,2024-05-11,"Experience of use 2 years Advantages 1. The absence of constantly tangled wires and, as a result, a feeling of lightness and freedom from the absence of wires (anyone who has ever used wireless headphones will understand me). 2. Miniature ‚Äì for those who care about the size of their headphones (headset), a more optimal size option cannot be found. 3. Ease of connection - everything is very simple - just turn on Bluetooth, open the case with the headphones and in the pop-up menu agree to synchronize the headphones and phone. 4. Holds a charge for a long time - one charge lasts for 4-5 hours. And considering that in everyday life rarely does anyone listen to music for so many hours in a row, the headphones always replenish their charge while lying in the case. 5. Music playback stops when you remove one earbud from your ear. 6. Double tap launches Siri and you can quickly dial a phone number or send an SMS by telling Siri what you need. 7. Excellent audibility (microphone performance) during conversations using these headphones. 8. Possibility of using one earphone as a headset."

The sound is so perfect and doesn't hurt me when is loud. Love them"
Great,devinf23,5,2024-05-11,"After owning AirPods for a while, I'm impressed. They seamlessly connect to Apple devices, fit comfortably, and offer good sound quality with decent bass.

"was skeptical, but these exceeded expectations. I'",ashleyl989,5,2024-05-09,"There is nothing to dislike about AirPods Pro 2, except maybe the price, but they're worth it. Sounds quality is superb compared to the first generation. I actually sold my gen 1 Pros and went back to the AirPods 2. How so much bass can come from such small drivers, I'll never know. The highs are crisp and clear and distortion does not exist, even with the volume on 100%. Mids are full and clear and not burried in the highs and lows. Definitely turn on Headphone Accommodations in accessibility settings to fine tune the sound to your liking. Noise Control is much better, letting almost no sounds in and because of the vent placement change, there's no suction anymore. Transparency Mode is sorcery, idk how they do it, but they do it better than any other earbuds. The new adaptive mode works well with conversation detection to be able to listen to your audio but still be able to converse randomly as needed. The case now works with find my on its own and has a speaker to play sounds along with precision finding. Battery life is better than stated, I easily get more than 6 hours from a single charge and I've only had to recharge the case one time with over a month of daily use. Quit hesitating and just buy them. You won't be disappointed."

Worth It!,jaclync45,4,2024-05-09,"I received these as a gift from my brothers on my birthday a few years back. I must admit, prior to getting these, I was a wire headphone girly. I really didn't want to make the switch to wireless/bluetooth headphones but I'm really glad I did! The sound quality is off the charts! It makes the music sound multi dimensional. When you turn your head, you hear the music as if it were being played live! I also really enjoy the noise cancelling feature. Sometimes I just throw them on without music to decompress and reduce stimuli and meditate. I'm pretty impressed with the battery life, I was expecting to have to charge them more frequently than I do. I absolutely love that my brothers decided to personalize my case, it made it extra special for me (I think they had an ulterior motive .. so I wouldn't return them lol). The reason I didn't give this product 5 stars is because I have a difficult time getting them to stay in my ears. I've tried all the different sized ear pieces but none of them quite seem small enough for my ear canal. It's frustrating when I'm in the car and one falls out and down the side of the seat and I have to spend the next 20 minutes trying to cram my hand between the console and the car seat. I also can't wear these while running because I constantly have to adjust them. I also occasionally have problems with the Bluetooth connecting to various devices. I seem to have the biggest problem when trying to pair it with my Peloton. I'm not sure if this is because of the AirPods or the bike. Overall, I'm really happy with these and am glad I finally made the switch!"

LOVE Apple AirPods,faithf79,4,2024-05-08,"I really loved the Apple AirPods. They are super lightweight and just the right size to carry anywhere. You can fit it in your bag, your backpack, your purse, and so much more. I have an iPad and an iPhone so they easily connect to both and I love how I can adjust the volume settings in my iPhone. The only thing I was not a fan of how it only comes in white so the cases easily get scratches on them and it looks worn out pretty fast. But there are cases for AirPods that can help protect and cover them."
Don't bother if you want long lasting sound.,Trent,2,2024-05-08,Don't bother if you want something for more than a month. Consistently cleaning the set and the right ear piece has lost almost all audio. You're better off with skull candy. It'll last longer and sound just slightly worse. Biggest waste of money In a while. Would return if possible. Purchased 3/26/24 - Review 5/9/24
Good and comfortable!,lyndseyo5,4,2024-05-08,"Easy to pair with good sound quality. I've found that these sit better in the ear than the Pro model. Comfortable for back to back calls! The battery life is good, but I've found that over the past year the quality has affected durability."
Good thing,ngocmai0863,5,2024-05-08,"Only issue I had was my usb driver crashing when I plug it into my desktop, but from my diagnosis the problem was not with the cable. Im just gonna blame apple and move on with my day."

"Build quality and appearance. Here, apple has always been ahead of the rest of the planet.",suidukhu,5,2024-05-08,"Comfortable. I really like the headphone form factor itself. That the EarPods and the wireless version sit very comfortably in the ear, I consider this form to be the most convenient. You can walk all day and there will be a minimum of discomfort from wearing. Synchronization and stable operation. Everything connects and works quickly. At the same time, you can be far away from the device and the sound will still be bright and clear. The very fact that there are no wires is wildly satisfying. You don't have to untangle anything every time. I just took it out of the case, they connected in a couple of seconds and you can enjoy the music."

Good headphones for a not too active lifestyle,rynep1,4,2024-05-08,These headphones helped me all throughout high school. Every day I wore these for years. Of course every now and then there were connectivity issues and the batteries don't last long now. (As expected) But the only issue with these is how they fit. I have the AirPod pros now with the silicone tips and they are way more comfortable. The sound quality was good but don't expect too much out of these little headphones. The bass definitely doesn't have the power I wish it did.

creat sounds quality and wireless,trizas1,4,2024-05-07,I love how its wireless and feels comfortable in the ears . It does have noise canceling feature it also decreases the volume on its own if you are talking to someone while listening music. It last couple of days onces full charged.

Awsome! Definitely buy!,zacharym31,5,2024-05-07,Sound quality is amazing compared to other models and brands out there. They are very durable as I've dropped them quite a bit with little to none damage. Very useful and easy to connect to iPhone as it is automatic.
Great for every day use!,kiahnau,4,2024-05-07,"Sound quality overall is pretty good, however they are not noise canceling. Which i wish they were for work. Battery life over time does die but they take few years to get to inconsistent batter life. They are fairly comfortable and easy to connect with your phone automatically."
AirPods are worth the buy!,kendrah116,5,2024-05-07,The sound quality is really good. I don't have issues with them staying in my ears. Battery life lasts for a while and charges quickly too. They connect super easy to my phone and laptop.

Not the best design for me. Maybe I have weird ears?,devonliane,2,2024-05-07,"Honestly, I'm not a huge fan of Apple's AirPods. I wanted to like them but I find the design just doesn't work well for my ears. They're constantly falling out. I ended up buying a pair of Beats earbuds and they're leaps and bounds better. The battery life on the AirPods doesn't even come close to my Beats' performance. All things considered, I think I'll be sticking with my Beats for the near future."
Perfect wireless headphones,,5,2024-05-07,Since day one of buying these I have absolutely loved them! Perfect on the go and even better for chores around the house. Being able to turn the noise cancellation on and off makes them perfect for vacuuming or mowing the lawn. The controls on the headphones themselves are super convenient when you don't want to carry your phone around and they have a decent Bluetooth reach

Amazing,alexism,5,2024-05-07,I love useing my AirPods for simple everyday tasks I couldn't get anything done without my jams. After 10+ hours your ears may seem to hurt a little but that doesn't stop them from having amazing sound.
They're great but expensive. You get what you pay for,leroyaboveall,4,2024-05-07,"AirPods have their pros and cons. Pros: light weight, loud, good bass.

worth the price for a superior wireless earbud,ji11ian,5,2024-05-06,"I have had these AirPods for about 5 years and they still work like new. Comparatively, I had a pair of beats headphones that only lasted about a year or two before the leather started coming off the foam pads. The earphones have a neutral sound profile that works well for all types of music/media. The best part about AirPods is the ability to effortlessly connect and switch between multiple different devices seamlessly. The charging case is conveniently small and portable compared to those for other wireless earbuds in my opinion. Being able to connect them to find my iPhone makes them easy to find if you misplace them as well."

Pretty comfortable but gets a little uncomfortable / painful after long use. Connectivity is pretty trash like If I were to walk into my room and my phones in the other room it isn't great
Good quality,shawnak32,4,2024-05-06,I personally prefer over the head headphones because these hurt my ears but if this is what you're looking for then they're great. They have great sound and durability. I've dropped them a million times and they haven't broke.
,WalmartCustomer,5,2024-05-06,It's a really good price! I remember paying like $50 more for them back in ****. They sound great too. Love everything about it.
"Spatial audio, sweat/water resistance, improved battery life, and slightly improved audio.",sergeyb1,5,2024-05-06,"The third-generation AirPods may look similar to the previous model at first glance, but side-by-side, their differences are immediately apparent. Both are open-style earbuds and have a stem-style design, but the stems on the newer AirPods are significantly shorter (1.21 inches vs. 1.59 inches) and better-sculpted for in-ear fit. Internally, the new model has a redesigned driver and even a skin-detect sensor that uses light reflections to determine if they are currently in your ear. An H1 wireless audio chip, the same one found in the second-generation AirPods and the AirPods Pro, also sits in each earphone along with a microphone designed to measure how your ear processes sound. The AirPods get the same IPX4 rating as the AirPods Pro, which means they are capable of withstanding a sweaty workout or light rain but not much beyond that. You can't submerge the earpieces or dunk them for cleaning; a slightly damp cloth is probably the safest bet. The charging case also gets an IPX4 rating, which notable because most true wireless earphones don't get any IP rating. Out of the box, the AirPods are ready to pair automatically with iPhones, iPads, and Macs once you flip open the charging case lid; we immediately got a prompt on our iPhone 13 for pairing when we opened the case the first time. The ability to pair the AirPods without having to go to the Bluetooth menu is always something we appreciate. You can connect them to non-Apple products through the standard Bluetooth pairing process. We tested the third-generation AirPods' audio quality with Spatial Audio turned off, though we discuss that feature in the next section. Simply, the new AirPods offer a balanced, clear sound with solid anchoring in the lows and definition in the highs. On tracks with intense sub-bass content, like The Knife's ‚ÄúSilent Shout,‚Äù the AirPods deliver some serious low-frequency depth, regardless of volume level. This is a significant development because the second-generation model struggled to reproduce bass depth even at moderate volume levels. At maximum volume levels (and these drivers can get far louder than they need to, or should), there's no distortion. L ove the sound quality, battery life and fit of the headphones. For example, they mention the spatial audio is a really cool feature, noise cancelation is good for studying and that they last at least a couple of hours. That said, some complain about the fit. Opinions are mixed on comfort and quality."

They're also pretty durable, I've seen her drop them a couple times and they still work and look perfectly. I'm definitely happy with my purchase she loves them and won't go anywhere without them. I also love how they fit perfectly into her ears, normally she doesn't like how earbuds fit in her ears. I've already told alot of friends and family how much we love them and I'll continue to recommend them."

Fantastic w/ a couple cons!,makaylae34,4,2024-04-30,"Great product, they've worked for years, but they fall out a bit while exercising and I think sweating has made them struggle. But other than that the noise canceling and filtering is so nice! Sound quality is GREAT!"

AirPods original's Biggest Fan,sparkbark,5,2024-04-30,"I have 5 pairs of these original AirPods!!! All others hurt my ears - these originals just fit the best. One two pairs have gone swimming in the neighborhood pool, one pair has been washed and dried with clothing, one got left on a hotel bed on a work trip and I'm still using them all at one point or another. Battery life before abused is excellent; after normal abuse (including swimming) they've dried out fine and worked well just don't hold a battery charge quite as long - but still pretty good! I am about to stock up and buy two more pairs!!!!! These are my all time favorite. I dislike noise cancelling ones because I can hear my own heartbeat when the ear canal is sealed off. These work great and sync to Apple and chrome for work meetings too. Just all around spectacular earphones."

AirPods,nazgulb1,5,2024-04-30,"I like AirPods are the perfect combination of convenience, sound quality and stylish design. Their seamless integration with Apple devices allows me to enjoy music and calls effortlessly. The sound quality of AirPods is simply amazing - clear highs, deep bass and good isolation from ambient noise create an impressive audio experience. With auto-on and plug-in functionality, AirPods are ready to use almost instantly after they're taken out of the box. This makes them an ideal choice for an active lifestyle and travel. Additionally, their ease of use and long battery life make them a great choice for daily use. Without a doubt, AirPods are more than just headphones, they are part of my daily experience that makes my day easier and brings pleasure to listening to music and communicating."

Random Charging/connecting issues,hthrm,4,2024-04-30,"Don't get me wrong, these work great but there's a couple bugs with the product that make it impossible for me to give 5 stars. Sometimes only one pod connects. It can be annoying to re-establish the Bluetooth connection when this happens. I've also experienced only one pod charging at a time. At the price point these things shouldn't happen."

Can't go wrong,annah799,4,2024-04-29,I've had these for the last 5 years and they work like brand new.

On the go,itsjustmeghan,3,2024-04-29,"Good for a short while if you're looking to try something new, they last for 2-3 months then they start to die down and leak if you don't maintain and clean them regularly.

A must buy,,5,2024-04-28,"I was on the fence of getting these for years and finally for one Christmas. I asked my parents for them due to me feeling like they would be helpful with my job. The convenience of no cord being wrapped around anything or being sat on or pulled from anywhere because you forget, it's there is amazing.I feel like I do not have to charge my battery as much as I thought I would and trust me I use them a lot"

I think they're worth it!,morgan1996,5,2024-04-28,I love my AirPods. They stay charged for days. Super comfy and sleek. The sound quality is great. Super easy to connect to your phone and stay connected.
Ok for price point,Steven,3,2024-04-28,They are ok for cheap backups. Easy to carry and use on the go. Won't try the pros because my ears are weird and I already know they wouldn't stay in. These original style do. Wouldn't get these if you use Apple Music- Apple only has basic preprogrammed EQ not full EQ so the quality is horrible. Need something like Spotify for a full EQ. I still mostly use Bose over ear headphones if I want audio quality.

I won't survive without my Air Pods üéµ,ohlookitsolivia,5,2024-04-28,"I love my AirPods. The charge lasts a long time and once it needs a charge it gets back up to its 100% fairly quickly. They connect easily and produces a great sound quality. I can still hear a bit of what is going on around me but if I turn it up a bit more then I can drown out any background noise. Having both options available in ear buds is important as there are times you need to be more aware than others. The air pods are relatively comfortable in the ear. I don't find that my ears get irritated when using these for long periods of time. I decorated my AirPod case with gems and half pearls to add a little shine to my life and that has been a welcomed addition. I will never be able to survive without my air pods as I use them every day, multiple times a day."

Plan on replacing within the year,ryans206,3,2024-04-28,The AirPods are nice to have but it seems as if after only about 6 months of use they aren't holding up to the quality that I would expect from Apple. The battery life gets less and less each day. They do fit comfortably in my ears and the fit is almost spot on. Sometimes the connectivity is spotty and over the time spent owning them I can't be as far away.

Better than I expected!,ajd0188,4,2024-04-24,"These AirPods are nice. I initially didn't want them, as I didn't think I needed them. It's so nice to be hands free from my phone.

Not the best for me,jaayk_,3,2024-04-23,"Good battery life and sound, but uncomfortable (to me) and constantly fall out of my ears. One of the buds stopped working, so I don't use them anymore. I'll stick to the corded headphones or beats"

Great sound quality,dinaglams,5,2024-04-23,"Apple's AirPods have revolutionized the wireless earbud market with their sleek design and user-friendly features.

"over the years, it stops connecting immediately, as if it does not see a signal in access",solomiiav1,5,2024-04-23,"I have been using them since 2019, and they still work. The sound is good, the main thing is to clean the headphones) Assembled well, despite how many times they fell (not much) Everything still works. The battery is great, they last a long time, they are comfortable. But personally, when I do sports or something, the earmuffs fall out of my ears, but this is the case with all my headphones)))) .good price I am satisfied with the purchase. The only nuance, I noticed that now for some reason they sometimes disconnect and when you try to connect, you do not see them in access"

,Timausia,1,2024-04-23,bought the airpods before going on a trip. they were on sale. despite waiting 30 minutes for the sales associate to bring them. i get on the road and the left airpod does not work. this has happened to me before. i'm done buying airpods at this point.
"Good, but can definitely be better",chowderpanda,3,2024-04-22,"I'll start off by saying these are not my favorite Apple Product unfortunately. While the battery life, sound quality, and connectivity features are decent, the overall feel that these earbuds give me are not great. The smooth plastic earpiece tends to slide and shift around as it only sits in the inner conch of your ear. I find this to be really bad for working out or even just going for a walk. Because they are just seated in the conch and don't have a seal on your ear I also find that the sound isn't as crisp because of the lack of noise cancelation, I can hear a good amount if what's going on around me outside of the earbuds. They certainly aren't terrible headphones, but I much prefer the airpod pro's with the silicone bud."
I recommend it,emmanuellaj2,5,2024-04-22,"Sure, here's a more detailed review focusing on those aspects: Sound quality: AirPods deliver decent sound quality with clear vocals and a balanced sound profile. While they may not offer audiophile-level quality, they provide a satisfactory listening experience for most users, especially for casual listening. Battery life: AirPods typically offer around 5 hours of listening time on a single charge, with the charging case providing additional charges for a total of over 24 hours of listening time. This makes them suitable for all-day use with intermittent charging breaks. Comfort: AirPods are lightweight and ergonomically designed to fit comfortably in the ears for most users. The lack of wires adds to their comfort, and the optional silicone tips provide a customizable fit for added comfort and stability during extended wear. Durability: AirPods are generally well-built, but some users have reported issues with durability over time, such as battery degradation or connectivity issues. Proper care, such as avoiding exposure to moisture and storing them in their case when not in use, can help prolong their lifespan. Connectivity: AirPods offer seamless connectivity with Apple devices thanks to the W1 or H1 chip, providing quick and stable pairing and reliable wireless performance. They also support features like automatic switching between devices signed in to the same iCloud account, further enhancing the user experience. Overall, AirPods offer a convenient and reliable wireless audio experience with decent sound quality, satisfactory battery life, comfortable fit, and seamless connectivity, although their durability may vary depending on usage and handling."

I find these to be extremely comfortable & easy to use.

Sound good,,5,2024-04-22,I got them as a anniversary gift for my husband. This is like the 2 ones i had to buy for him.

Great Product Worth the money,shannonh1,5,2024-04-22,I bought Air pods on recommendation from my son. I absolutely love them. I was so used to using cheap headphones where people couldn't hear me on the phone. I don't have that problem anymore. The quality of sound is amazing.

They're great for making sure a call stays private without having to have the phone to your ear. Sound quality was surprisingly clear, bass as well!

Sound quality,hanans6,5,2024-04-22,This is one of the many satisfactory solutions to the problem we are all facing these days as our OG airpods start seeing the effects of heavy use. When I first opened this item I noticed a heavy hinge when opening and closing the case and an audible click with every movement. it felt cheap and I did not like it but it quickly went away after some repeated use. The only issue making me remove a star is the fact that the airpods do not stay firmly seated within the case. when open you can push down on them about .5mm. regardless this does not seem to affect charging as they charge just fine when closed. This is a good solution to charging airpods. go ahead and get it.
,Sharlyn,1,2024-04-22,My right AirPod doesn't work
It has lasted me years!!,madisons584,5,2024-04-22,Let me start out by saying i have owned the same pair of AirPods for 5+ years and the quality has not changed. The sound and battery life are both still working great! They're the most comfortable headphones that fit in my ears.
They are worth the purchase minus the battery life,rachellet19,4,2024-04-22,"I love the sound quality of these AirPods , I also love how easy they are to connect. The battery life could be better but overall they are worth it ."
Good sound,miladuen,5,2024-04-22,"The sound quality is so good ! battery life is long, they don't fall down when i'm working out. They are durable and the connection to bluetooth was fast."
This will last all day charged,sabrinah299,5,2024-04-22,"Very comfortable to use on the go, while you are at the gym or on the go. Battery keeps all day. Very soothing to the ears good sound quality. Connects to bluetooth in a quick second"
I love my AirPods,beautibyvee,5,2024-04-22,"The sound quality is superb! It easily connects with no problem to my IPhone. The soft ear cushioning makes it comfortable for me to wear all day. It holds a charge for a reasonable amount of time, so the battery life is okay."
Perfect for On-The-Go!,alext221,5,2024-04-22,"I am an avid Beats Headphones user, and while they are my preferred brand, wearing those heavy earmuffs during your workouts or the hot summer months can be exhausting! After hearing (no pun intended) all of the hype around Apple AirPods, I finally caved and bought a pair. While the sound quality is not as good as Beats, and understandably so given the price difference, they're still pretty good! The light, wireless design makes it the perfect choice for anyone on-the-go or who wants an affordable option to listen to their favorite music, podcasts, or whatever!"
Superb sound,amber_bosco2000,5,2024-04-22,Sound quality is superb! They last super long with a charge and they will charge fully very quickly. They are super comfortable in my ears as well! I never have a problem connecting them to my phone or computer

Great airpods that work well,Aly,5,2024-04-22,it's apple so it all works together as it should
I recommend it,emmanuellaj2,5,2024-04-22,"Sure, here's a more detailed review focusing on those aspects: Sound quality: AirPods deliver decent sound quality with clear vocals and a balanced sound profile. While they may not offer audiophile-level quality, they provide a satisfactory listening experience for most users, especially for casual listening. Battery life: AirPods typically offer around 5 hours of listening time on a single charge, with the charging case providing additional charges for a total of over 24 hours of listening time. This makes them suitable for all-day use with intermittent charging breaks. Comfort: AirPods are lightweight and ergonomically designed to fit comfortably in the ears for most users. The lack of wires adds to their comfort, and the optional silicone tips provide a customizable fit for added comfort and stability during extended wear. Durability: AirPods are generally well-built, but some users have reported issues with durability over time, such as battery degradation or connectivity issues. Proper care, such as avoiding exposure to moisture and storing them in their case when not in use, can help prolong their lifespan. Connectivity: AirPods offer seamless connectivity with Apple devices thanks to the W1 or H1 chip, providing quick and stable pairing and reliable wireless performance. They also support features like automatic switching between devices signed in to the same iCloud account, further enhancing the user experience. Overall, AirPods offer a convenient and reliable wireless audio experience with decent sound quality, satisfactory battery life, comfortable fit, and seamless connectivity, although their durability may vary depending on usage and handling."

However, some may find the fit less secure compared to other earbuds, and the lack of customizable controls could be a drawback for some users. Overall, Apple AirPods excel in providing a hassle-free wireless audio solution for Apple ecosystem users."
Long lasting,ashleyl865,5,2024-04-18,"I currently have the very 1st generation of AirPods and they are still going strong. The sound quality is still up to par and they are comfortable to wear. They connect easily to my phone, iPad, computer and even my Apple TV."
Not for working out,gracielas20,3,2024-04-18,"Good quality and durable but they won't stay on my ears if I move a lot. Great for days I'm seating on my desk or relaxing. Not good for working out, maybe for walks but not more than that"
Airpods=tangle free headphones,elifz1,5,2024-04-18,"Airpods are the best thing ever you if you don't want to fix the tangle you have with your wired headphones. It's comfortable, you charge it and it lasts you so long! Put them on and listen to your favorite song"

Great product for anyone who likes to listen to music or talking on the phone whithou having to hold the phone to your face,kimn206,4,2024-04-18,As we all know that apple has pretty good quality with their products. This AirPod is one of them. The sound quality is really great. It will last for a long time without having to charge it. When you do need to you can always charge one and listen to one without worrying that you don't have an earpiece to listen to. All in all great product. And not bad in price either.
Worth paying for ‚Ä¶,yend11,5,2024-04-17,"I love my original AirPods. I use them all the time so I decided to take advantage of the sale and buy a backup pair. No I can use a pair while the other pair is charging. If you're wondering if they can survive a car roll they can! The sound is amazing, bass is great. These little things have been going strong for over a year and have been going strong for 6 months after a car roll. Safe to say they're worth the money."

Very comfortable,brh,5,2024-04-17,"These are my favorite AirPods! These are the older version of AirPods but I had tried the generation 3 and I did not like the shape of the AirPods. These are very comfortable when working out and for everyday use. They do not fall out of my ear as easily as the generation 3 do. The battery life is amazing on these, it lasts me for a couple of days. I use this product when I'm studying, watching music, or listening to music. If you are looking for AirPods that are comfortable and on the cheaper side these are definitely it!!!"

So I decided to buy the new ones. Lots of features, sounds great. Accidentally went through not only the washing machine, but dryer too and they still work! Great quality. Best in my opinion as someone who's owned JBL, Beats, and Jaybird wireless earbuds. These are the best hands down. Well worth the price."

Long battery life!,diegop62,4,2024-04-16,"I enjoy having wireless earbuds and my current favorite are my AirPods.

Always a good option,emilys1371,3,2024-04-16,I love my AirPods but i do think the sound quality could be better and louder. The battery life lasts a good amount of time and for someone who has always has issues with headphones hurting in my ears these are very comfortable. My main issue is just wanting them to be louder for music.
Don't recommend air pod pro 1st gen 2nd gen maybe better,brooklynw89,3,2024-04-16,"The battery life is not bad lasts 5-6 hrs, sound quality not ver good, I cannot hear much from the right ear even tried troubleshooting, left loud"

Good product!,avam294,4,2024-04-16,I love having my airpods with me in everyday lifestyle and long or even short trips. The only complaint i have is over time they start working less good like they start not pairing with devices and they can start leaking put sound but other than that i love them!

Excellent,Carlos,5,2024-04-16,Excellent if you have apple devices. Automatically switches between devices as you change from Mac to iPad to iPhone. It just knows which you're using. Fully customizable and excellent sound. And cheaper than the pro models haha.
Battery life sucks,jammed,3,2024-04-16,"My favorite thing about the airpods is probably how convenient they are when traveling. However, the battery life has been a problem. The sound quality is great and all, but it gets ruined by the fact that the battery dies over time and slowly dies faster each time you use it."

Overall satisfied",patricka31,4,2024-04-16,"Decent battery life, has good sound quality aswell. Can walk about 100 feet away from my phone without them disconnecting.

Exceptional Convenience and Immersive Audio,jimc079,5,2024-04-16,"As an avid consumer of technological innovations, I recently had the opportunity to experience Apple AirPods, and I must say, they have significantly exceeded my expectations. First and foremost, the design of the AirPods is sleek and minimalistic, embodying Apple's commitment to aesthetic appeal and functionality. The effortless pairing process with Apple devices is a testament to their seamless integration into the Apple ecosystem. In terms of audio quality, the AirPods deliver an immersive listening experience. The sound is crisp and clear, with well-balanced bass and treble, allowing me to enjoy my favorite music, podcasts, and videos with unparalleled clarity. One of the standout features of the AirPods is their convenience. The wireless design eliminates the hassle of tangled cords, providing freedom of movement during daily activities. Additionally, the compact charging case ensures that the AirPods are always ready for use, extending their usability throughout the day. I was also impressed by the intuitive controls offered by the AirPods. From activating Siri with a simple voice command to seamlessly switching between devices, the AirPods make navigation effortless and intuitive. Furthermore, the battery life of the AirPods is commendable, offering hours of continuous use on a single charge. The quick charging feature is particularly convenient for those on the go, providing additional peace of mind. In terms of comfort, the AirPods fit snugly in the ears and remain secure during movement, making them suitable for extended wear. Overall, I wholeheartedly recommend Apple AirPods to anyone in search of wireless earbuds that excel in both performance and convenience. Whether you're a music enthusiast, a podcast aficionado, or simply seeking a hassle-free audio solution, the AirPods are sure to impress with their exceptional sound quality, seamless integration, and unparalleled convenience."
Amazing Product!,emmah791,5,2024-04-16,"The sound quality is amazing. Best earbuds ever!! They are also super comfortable! The battery life is also amazing, mine stay charged for over a week!

Reliable,mares11,4,2024-04-15,"Had these for around 3 years and worked pretty consistently throughout that time. Finally had them stolen (lol), so I upgraded to the new gen. Definitely see more improvements with those."
Overall pretty good,emmab717,4,2024-04-15,"These are really nice to have when you need to keep on ear open as well as not having a completely tangled mess of a cord. The sound comes through really clearly. The battery lasts a lot longer than I would have expected and you can charge them in the case without connecting to the wall as long as the case is charged. The only thing I find slightly difficult is when connecting them, it sometimes connects to a different device that they're added to before it goes to the right one."
Apple Air Pods- Great!,Hannah,5,2024-04-15,"I am very pleased with this product. I highly recommend for anyone who is looking to buy AirPods. The price is great and the battery last a long time! I think I used them for like almost 2 weeks straight once (given I only really use at the gym). Also, if you are looking for a cute case, Shein has many many many cute ones for the Airpods 1/2. Highly recommend! You will not regret this purchase. I bought them when they went on sale last year for Black Friday - I saved like 60$ doing that!"

"Apple Earbuds:
So far so good!! Just received them",Birdie,4,2024-04-15,I really can't rate the earbuds. I just received them and so far they are great! Easy to use and a great price!
Great for traveling,dianeishere,4,2024-04-15,I had gotten apple AirPods a few years ago and I love that they are so easy to travel with! I always pull them out when I'm on the plane because I like to listen to music throughout. Only bummer is it doesn't plug into the plane so I can hear what's on the airplane tv screen but that's okay!
Great AirPods. Love it!,alinap115,5,2024-04-15,This airpods are great. Ease of use and the set up is simple. I just purchased another airpods gen 2nd because they are in a good deal. But my 1st one is still working really good. The sound of listening is always great. It's automatically connected every time I wqnt to use and the battery is last for almost 2 days. I hope my new AirPods will work well like my 1st AirPods.

Must have,jamieb399,4,2024-04-15,"I love how convenient these are! They stay in my ears, are easy to hook up to my devices and easy to transport. The sound quality is also great! The battery life is also impressive"
Not worth the money,torib173,3,2024-04-15,"I've had the Apple AirPods for a few years now. When I first got them, they were PERFECT! Very comfortable and they did what I needed them to. However, as the years go by, they lessen with sound quality, comfort and overall battery life. I find myself barely using them anymore because when I put them on (the right one) hardly any sound comes out. Left one works fine but the sound has dulled. Not as loud as they used to be at all. Me personally, I like to buy things that last. With that being said I wouldn't buy these but this could be just my experience with them!"
Pretty good,oh_weedy,4,2024-04-15,These airpods were pretty good for the price but I think there's better for the price. The pros are alot better and alot more worth the price but these are good for kids/teens.
I wouldn't buy again not worth the money,sethl15,1,2024-04-15,Very disappointed the sound went out of the right side first. Then the left side went out. The battery life was horrible didn't last long at all. It was very comfortable in the ears but that's it
They are perfect,Stacy,5,2024-04-15,I like not having to go inside and still getting all my needs. Thanks
stops working within a month,miabrianna,3,2024-04-15,"Good quality at first and connects easily, the sound quality is good until it isnt.

Love it,huongv2,5,2024-04-15,"AirPods have become my everyday essential. The convenience of popping them in and instantly being immersed in my favorite tunes or able to take calls without any hassle is unbeatable. The sound quality is surprisingly good, and I love how seamlessly they integrate with all my Apple devices. Plus, the sleek design just adds that extra touch of cool to my daily look."
Compact perfection,samanthas1311,5,2024-04-15,"My apple air pods are amazing I especially love them when I'm busy doing something and my phone is in my pocket, they connect automatically to my phone, no issues. The battery life is amazing, I barely have to charge them it seems and they are really comfortable in my ears."
stops working within a month,miabrianna,3,2024-04-15,"Good quality at first and connects easily, the sound quality is good until it isnt. I like them but i dont recommend because they stop working quickly and the right airpod always puts out on me for every pair ive gotten. the airpod maxes are good but they leak and personally i dont like my music being heard."

Great purchase!,ashleeg56,5,2024-04-14,Very happy with my purchase of these AirPods. As a busy mom it makes it so easy to take a phone call or catch up with friends while still being hands free! They're comfortable. The battery lasts a long time! I've not had any issues in over 2 years with these!
In-Depth User Review: Apple AirPods Pro - A Blend of Premium Sound and Seamless Functionality,gracemayugc,4,2024-04-14,"What I Liked: Active Noise Cancellation (ANC): The ANC feature is exceptionally effective. It significantly reduces ambient noise, which is perfect for my commutes and busy office environment. The ability to switch to Transparency mode quickly is also very useful when I need to hear announcements or engage in quick conversations without removing the earbuds. Comfort and Fit: The inclusion of three different sizes of silicone tips helped me find a perfect fit that stays secure in my ears during various activities, including running and gym workouts. Sound Quality: The sound quality is impressive with a good balance of bass and clarity, making both music and podcasts enjoyable. Integration with Apple Ecosystem: The seamless integration with iOS devices is a big plus. Features like automatic device switching, spatial audio, and on-ear controls enhance the user experience substantially. What I Disliked: Battery Life: While generally decent, the battery life can be a limiting factor during long travel days without access to a charger. The 4.5 hours of listening time with ANC on isn't always enough. Price: They are on the pricier side compared to some competitors, which might put them out of reach for some users. Usage Scenarios: I've used the AirPods Pro extensively both indoors and outdoors. They've been particularly useful in noisy environments like airports and cafes due to their ANC. At home, the Transparency mode allows me to remain aware of my surroundings, which is helpful when I need to listen out for deliveries or calls. Recommendation: Yes, I would recommend the AirPods Pro to anyone looking for versatile, high-quality earbuds, especially if you're already within the Apple ecosystem. The ease of use, sound quality, and features like ANC make them a worthwhile investment. Before You Buy: I wish I had known more about the battery management and the actual duration of playtime with ANC active. Also, understanding the full capabilities of spatial audio with compatible content would have been useful, as it truly enhances the viewing experience on supported platforms."

Great for a little while,tarag161,4,2024-04-12,I really liked these airpods for a few months. They are comfortable and the audio was great.

Pretty good,camerenj1,4,2024-04-12,"The battery lufe is honestly pretty good, mostly last me a day and are great but I find myself having to buy new ones every 2 years or so just because they start to sound a little foggy and underwater like they fit comfortably in my ears and are a great pick for workouts"

Overall good product for everyday use,jadi_lee17,4,2024-04-12,These are a very popular and sought after product. AirPods have good sound quality but for the regular AirPods the quality does go down. They are a good choice to use everyday and have a long lasting battery life. They won't break on you and easily connect to your devices.
great for the price,Jules,4,2024-04-12,"we got these on sale and they have been great. they hold a decent charge and are well made. the only downside is that they don't fit great in smaller ears. they do fot well enough that they dont fall out, though."

Not the worst,morganl229,5,2024-04-12,"Honestly, they work about how you would expect the sounds good and they have lasted me a pretty good. The only downside I have with them after about 30 minutes of using them. They start hurt my ears pretty bad and I have to take them out but they get the job done. Ôøº"
Best earbuds i've ever used,shawnav8,5,2024-04-11,"Great earbuds for everyday wear, This are by far my favorite earbuds I've ever purchased the battery life on the last me so long as I use them every day in the gym when they drop they don't break or scratch.

AirPod snuck stopped working,Nyheema,1,2024-04-11,I gotten AirPods around Christmas Tim and they are starting to be defective. The left AirPod mic stopped working and hard to hear out of the AirPods.
One of the better headphones on the market!,sarao106,4,2024-04-11,Good sound quality. The noise cancelling is great. They last long and don't have to charge too often. Connects right to the phone when putting in ear. Only complaint is they do fall out sometime.
not worth all the hype,Jeanine,1,2024-04-11,these have good sound and some noise cancelling as well but within 3 months the sound will be minimal even on the highest volume setting and while fully charged. not worth it in my opinion for the durability.
"They have an accelerometer to sense gestures, optical sensors to detect if they're in your ears, and microphones for phone calls. AirPods also support spatial audio, Dolby Atmos, IPX4 water resistance, and skin detection.",louimenee,3,2024-04-11,"I've really been using this product for 5 years already. AirPods last six hours, and the charging case provides up to 30 hours. Press the stem to play and pause audio, double-press the stem to play the next track, triple-press the stem to play the previous track, and press the stem to answer a call. Press and hold the stem to activate Siri. The second generation AirPods have Transparency mode, which lets you hear the world around you. You"
"Beginner friendly, easy to use!",makennac32,4,2024-04-11,I had these AirPods for a very long time. Probably roughly 3 years. The battery life is very long. I can got a few days without charging them. If I open the top of the case they always just connect automatically to my phone. The sound quality is great but they are kind of a challenged to use when making a phone call. They are some what comfortable. They can fall out pretty easily. The case however does scratch very well and gets dirty very easily. You need to have a case for them in order for them to be in good condition and last awhile.
They don't stay put,simones118,3,2024-04-11,"Sound quality is great. Comfort is not the best. They always fall out of my ears. The battery last a long time which is nice. They are super easy to lose.

The best earbuds on the market!,wendyh235,4,2024-04-11,"I love my Airpods. I use them everyday when exercising, attending business meetings, and just on the go. They have great sound and give you warnings for sound control. The battery stays charged all day for me which has been Amazing!"

Haven't found a good fit,kimh437,3,2024-04-10,"For whatever reason, I have a very hard time getting my AirPod Pros to stay in my ears, regardless of the size attachment I use.

Everyday Headphones,kyrat16,4,2024-04-10,"These are my go to wireless headphones. I use them because they are compatible with my iPhone, so it makes it easy to use. With the charging case these headphones only need to be charged maybe once a week or after about 10 hours is what I usually go by. The sound quality is good but doesn't block out our surroundings. I use mine for walking, commuting, or doing chores. They do fall out of my ear if I try running or moving more athletically with them. I have other headphones for working out. But these are great for everyday and very sleek and don't draw attention. They also are amazing for meetings so that I can listen while moving around and don't need my phone close to me."

Game changer,alexaaaad,4,2024-04-10,Love my AirPods. Having wireless headphones is such a game changer. After having them for a few years I do feel like the sound quality isn't good anymore and even the loudest volume often isn't loud enough. One AirPod often is quieter than the other. Tough to clean. Might need to buy a new pair soon but overall they are worth it.

Apple's Airpods,vivianxpena,5,2024-04-10,"The Apple AirPods offer a seamless wireless experience that's hard to beat. Their sleek design, comfortable fit, and easy pairing with Apple devices make them a convenient choice for everyday use. While the sound quality may not be audiophile-level, it's still impressive for their size, delivering clear vocals and decent bass.

Its worth it! Read below,Shadow,5,2024-04-10,Trust me buy it I sat there for days and hours reading negative reviews but there's a reason it's rated 4.7 stars. I got them delivered not shipped and they were great. I've used them they're not from a third party they are great! Trust me when I say its worth it I just recommend buying it in-store or getting it delivered.

Game changer,alexaaaad,4,2024-04-10,Love my AirPods. Having wireless headphones is such a game changer. After having them for a few years I do feel like the sound quality isn't good anymore and even the loudest volume often isn't loud enough. One AirPod often is quieter than the other. Tough to clean. Might need to buy a new pair soon but overall they are worth it.
Pretty good,Aaron,3,2024-04-10,They aren't the loudest and they glitch a bit but other than that they are great.
Frank,Ferenc,5,2024-04-10,Great product.
Great product.  Easy to use,Joleen,5,2024-04-10,bought as a christmas gift. works great! no issues
Apple's Airpods,vivianxpena,5,2024-04-10,"The Apple AirPods offer a seamless wireless experience that's hard to beat. Their sleek design, comfortable fit, and easy pairing with Apple devices make them a convenient choice for everyday use. While the sound quality may not be audiophile-level, it's still impressive for their size, delivering clear vocals and decent bass. The addition of Siri integration adds to their versatility, allowing for hands-free control of music and calls. Overall, the Apple AirPods are a solid option for those looking for hassle-free wireless earbuds with the Apple ecosystem integration."
they only last about 8 months as quality and battery life gets worse.,madisonh420,3,2024-04-10,"they start to loose the sound quality over time and eventually one of them stops working until you have to end up getting a new pair, they only last for about 8 months. battery at first will last for about 12 hours then go down to 6 hours."

I DID NOT RECEIVE MY AIRPODS,latwanice,1,2024-04-10,I received Pinesol instead‚Ä¶..I ordered AirPods and it was delivered to my house. The label said my name but it was the wrong item. How do you mix up pine sol and AirPods??? You don't.

Excellent,chrystalb29,4,2024-04-09,Top Notch! These headphones are great for the gym or just to wear everyday. The sound is optimal and the design is outstanding. The battery life is phenomenal. Easy to set up. The only 2 cons is when I wear these they sometimes fall out of my ear when I'm working out. Also they could be more comfortable. Def would buy again.

Overhyped,charityj6,2,2024-04-09,These are way too overhyped. They are not comfortable especially if you have smaller ears. They fall out a lot. The battery life dies quicker with every use. The only pro is that they have good sound quality.
,Kevin,4,2024-04-09,I really like everything about them but I have small ears so I have a hard time keeping them in place firmly!! Love the sound and a comfort a very good product

Sounds awesome!,festuss,4,2024-04-09,"These headphones sounded crisp and clear with my music on Apple Music. However, the only downside is, if you are doing a lot of walking, they seem to move around and will eventually fall out which is the reason for the 4 stars. I'm sure if they had rubber ends they wouldn't do this."

Wear these every day,brittw24,5,2024-04-09,"I wear these to bed every night so that I can listen to a meditation before bed. My only gripe is that if I fall asleep with them in, they will die and make a loud noise that wakes me up. Wish they would last through the whole night or go on standby when not playing music. But I do recommend them and find them quite comfortable."
Portale and great for students,ameliam175,5,2024-04-09,"I have had the same AirPod pros since sixth grade, and now I am in my freshman year of college. These are pros have never lost their sound quality or battery life. I take care of them very well, and have only had to replace one of the AirPods, because it got misplaced. Any generation of the AirPod is great. Highly recommend and they are very portable."

The sound and volume gets to where I need it to be, and I like that they charge quickly. Ôøº I took off a star because of how they will fall out of my ear if I turn, or lay on a certain side.

Apple AirPods With Charging Case,Brittany32360,4,2024-04-08,(This review was collected as part of a promotion.) I recently purchased these AirPods when they went on sale. They were a great investment and I love to travel with them. Made it easier to watch movies on a plane without disturbing other passengers.
Great basic model works better than tricked out model!,candyp30,3,2024-04-08,"Great quality for basic model can hear great, battery lasts for a reasonable time and has not problem connecting. More comfortable than the AirPod pro in fit and material. Mine have lasted for years!"
Great service!,Kelly,5,2024-04-08,My daughter needed a replacement set as her first we're on their way out. I found the very best deal online with Walmart. All other stores ended their sales. I placed the order in the morning and they were at our door in the evening. This was perfect timing as her left pod ended up going out totally that afternoon.
Exceptional for value,_mskimmy101,4,2024-04-08,"I ordered these 2nd Generation Apple Airpods over 6 months ago. To this day, they are in perfect working condition, nearly the same way I received them. Upon trying out the sound quality of them, using a single one sounds wonky for being a product of Apple. Using both of them makes the quality sound a bit better, but still is questionable. It also would have been a much better product if there was full noise cancellation. The Bluetooth functionalities are a bit tricky to me especially since if you are connected to your phone, connecting to another device such as your laptop, is time consuming and complex. Some cool features of these Apple Airpods are it's voice controlling functionality, can use through phone calls, double tap to skip, and if you have an Apple Watch, it works as a tiny remote for the volume. You also do not have much of a say when they come with a lightning speed charger. It's a double win if the device charges quickly and the device has a life of 5 hours without the need of a charger. For the value of this product, the effectiveness is fair."
An excellent and functional Apple product,Richard42784,5,2024-04-08,"(This review was collected as part of a promotion.) The second generation Apple AirPods with Charging Case is a must have accessory for any Apple iPhone user. The product quality is exceptional and is one that any Apple user has come to expect over the course of Apple iPhone and Apple iPhone accessory availability. The audio quality is excellent, clear and without interruption from background noise. The charging case is an intelligent and functional unit which allows charging while the AirPods are not in use. Highly recommended and a definite must have for the Apple product lover."
"Case, AirPods, and charger all work well",Francis,5,2024-04-08,"AirPods connected easily, case charges with no issues, and charger works well"
The sound quality is just alright.,jessc264,3,2024-04-08,"When I first got my airpods I genuinely loved them, having longer hair I was able to hide them and listen to music in class without distracting others. I had them for about a year until the speakers in the headphone ended up cracking. I haven't used them in a while because the volume on them is very hard to hear. The battery life is super well, they last for a while and charge super quickly!"
4th pair!,Jamie,4,2024-04-08,They usually go bad after a year. I needed another one. They get waxy so a lot of cleaning is needed for the AirPods to sense they are in my ears. They work and are fast to set up. So $100 annually isn't bad for something that gets 5-7 hours of use a day.
great,mackenzie,5,2024-04-08,got them for my boyfriend and he loves them.

Battery life was not good,christopherh90,4,2024-04-07,Battery life was a disappointment. At least for mine. Lasted half hour to forty five minutes. I don't believe this is typical for AirPods. I went back to my old school attached wire.
sound is great!,Patricia,5,2024-04-07,love the sound and they stay in my ears.
Replacement earbuds,Ada,5,2024-04-07,"I've previously owned a pair of this brand earbuds and have had them for about 3-4 years, wearing them everyday at work for ad least a 12 hour time frame.

"Online order 3 times, Walmart screwed all 3 up",Dustin,1,2024-04-07,"I have ordered airbuds 3 times online and you can't seem to a simple task. First time I ordered and paid for delivery and you sent to wrong address. I had to call and cancel. Then I re ordered and pay again for a pick up at your location, then you cancelled for no reason. Then I had to call again. Then your rep said I ordered again there will be no issue. My order I paid for a third time was suppose to be ready at 11:30 today. It's delayed with no eta. Are you capable of taking an order and allowing me to pick it up? It doesn't seem so."
Fantastic product!!,melissab1081,4,2024-04-07,"I had these AirPods prior to upgrading the the AirPod pros, and I loved them. They are comfortable, and the sound quality is amazing. They would last hours in between charges. So that was always awesome! They went through my washer a couple of times and still worked so I'd say they're very durable!"
They are handy and easy to use and don't take up any space,laurac1446,4,2024-04-07,Sound quality is great and I can take my music wherever I want to listen to it at. They hold good charge and easy to use. They connect easily and once you connect to ur phone they are always ready anytime after for use when you put them in ur ears.
THE SOUND GREAT BUT NOT YET AS EXPECTED,kyray3,4,2024-04-07,"I've been using the Apple AirPods with Charging Case for a few months now, and they've definitely changed the way l experience audio on the go. The convenience of these wireless earbuds is exceptional, and they come with some impressive features. Here's my take on these AirPods: Pros: Wireless Convenience: The seamless pairing process with my iPhone and other Apple devices is a standout feature. The moment you open the case, they're ready to connect, making switching between devices a breeze. Sound Quality: For earlouds of this size, the sound quality is impressive. The audio is clear, with decent bass and good overall balance. They're suitable for a wide range of genres, from podcasts to music. Battery Life: The battery life is quite good. I can easily go through a full day without needing to recharge the case, and the case itself holds multiple charges. Compact Charging Case: The included charging case is sleek and pocket-friendly. It provides protection and adds to the overall convenience by extending the AirPods' battery life on the go. Comfortable Fit: The fit is comfortable for extended use. I've worn them during workouts, and they stay in place reasonably well. Cons: Price: Like most Apple products, these AirPods are on the expensive side. While the quality is good, the price point might be a deal-breaker for some potential buyers. Isolation: The open design of the AirPods allows for some ambient noise to leak in, which might not be ideal in noisy environments. This lack of noise isolation can be a downside when compared to other earbuds. Durability: The glossy finish of the AirPods and case can be prone to scratches and scuffs over time. Some users might prefer a more durable, matte finish. Customization: While the touch controls are convenient, I wish there were more customization options for gestures. Currently, you're limited to a few basic commands. Overall, the Apple AirPods with Charging Case are a strong contender in the wireless earbuds market. They offer excellent convenience, sound quality, and battery life, though there are a few areas where they could improve, especially considering their premium price. If you're deeply integrated into the Apple ecosystem and value the seamless connectivity, these AirPods are a solid choice. However, if you're looking for maximum noise isolation or are on a tight budget, you might want to explore other options."
"Good value for the cost, decent quality, variety of options while use",thib7,5,2024-04-06,"I've used newer generation AirPods, and these are good for if I'm on a budget. Because of the cost I was able to gift these to my girlfriend who never had AirPods at absolutely loves these. There are plenty of things that you can do while wearing the AirPods including answer the call, hang up and even mute, so it's great that these have a lot of different features. Other simply don't I do like how they fit in your ear and personally I've had these before as well and they do stay put pretty well I will say that when my girlfriend is wearing the AirPods and we're speaking on the phone that her voice and the sound is lower than if she was on speaker even though my volume is up all the way she sometimes still comes in at a lower volume. I will say that it's super convenient to have a chargeable case where you can charge the AirPods without having to plug anything in and then charge the case either with or without the AirPods as needed. These are good quality and I know because I've owned them and use them that they lasted for me at least Few years"

Great for a couple years!,livvyk2,4,2024-04-06,They last a good 2-3 years. Great headphones; but I'm sure it's time for a new pair for me :) I honestly had no problems with them other than the sound fading after a couple years but that's expected.
Perfect,marco,5,2024-04-05,Thanks for the timely delivery. It is exactly what I needed. I got one for me and the other as a gift. Can't wait to put them to good use

Washing machine proof!,ashleytugwell,5,2024-04-05,I've had the same pair of air pods since the beginning of 2020 and they are still working without any issues at all! Really love how durable these have been. I even washed the earbuds in the washing machine once‚Äîjust let them dry in a bag of rice and they still worked just as if I never washed them!

I still love my air pods,rosaf98,4,2024-04-05,I love my air pods and i've had them for a long time lol. But after years of having them they're not as loud anymore and my battery sometimes dies quickly. And they disconnects and connect in the middle of when when im listening to music or watching a video and its fully charged.

Love my AirPods,khamv,4,2024-04-05,I love Apple AirPods. This one is the pro second gen and I love that it can charge wirelessly and that it charges fast.

Great sound quality,daneiceah,5,2024-04-05,"Apple AirPods have been an essential when working, I am a personal shopper at Walmart so having AirPods to be able to listen to music or an audio book without disturbing the public or my coworkers is amazing. I am able to get work done faster because I have something I am Interested in playing in my ear. I love my Apple air pods."

Great clear sound,mikew10,4,2024-04-05,The best ear pod in my opinion. It gives you clear sound that's adjustable volume. It's durable and has great battery life. It connects to most devices easily with no problem.
I use them every day,mihaelab33,5,2024-04-05,"The Apple AirPods have been an absolute game-changer for me. Their seamless connectivity with my devices, impressive sound quality, and the convenience of being wire-free enhance my audio experience significantly.

A must-have for anyone in the Apple ecosystem."
Sent used AirPods,Susan,1,2024-04-05,Had someone's name already assigned to the AirPod when pairing. It was shrink wrap but who knows if Walmart rewrapped it. I thought it's advertised as new. Not happy.
Daily use,hannahs395,4,2024-04-05,I have used these for about 4 years now and the only thing I don't like are the ear infections I get from them. I can't leave them in all day with out getting uncomfortable but the sound is good and battery lasts long
Unsatisfied,alyssa,1,2024-04-05,Do not purchase a protection plan. AirPods received were defective and I was offered a pair of used AirPods to replace them with. This is completely unacceptable.

Comfortable ear pods with three different modes,susanl205,5,2024-04-05,"I always reach for my airpods! The sound quality is great especially, the three different modes. I use them for the gym and never have an issue with the battery life as they last couple of hours. I have dropped them multiple times and they are super durable, never had an issue with them."

Best Headphones Ever,amberb833,5,2024-04-05,"These bad noys have lasted me about 5 years now. They have never failed me or had any issues. They are insanely comfortable and have amazing quality! Sometimes, connecting can be a hassle but I do have the first generation AirPods. The battery life only lasts me 3 hours now, but it's something I can deal with considering the age."

,WalmartCustomer,5,2024-04-04,The price was the best I could find while looking through other websites! The AirPods are good quality and work great.
Terrible,agneskb627,3,2024-04-04,"I have been using these AirPods for three years, but they did not last long. After just one year, they stopped working, and the sound quality would often become muffled, making it difficult for me to hear anything. I am not sure if this is a common issue or if it is just happening to me, but my experience did not live up to the hype surrounding AirPods."
Sound and durability is great,isabellam296,3,2024-04-04,The durability is great. I've had these for 6 years now and sad to say but they're finally on their last leg. Sound quality has been amazing and not once has the volume or sound let me down. Apple AirPods gives it all to you plus great comfort and your ears don't hurt after a long day.
Best,thtgrlsamm,5,2024-04-04,"I carry these religiously. Absolute favorite. Perfect sound. Batter last forever. They actually fit in my ears very well, which is always trouble for me. I have no issues getting them to connect to my phone. And that case has been through it all. Still great."
All the qualities one would like.,nenyaabrown,3,2024-04-04,"Crisp clean sound from such a small item. These pods would be the perfect choice for my morning sound if only they would stay in my ears. They are not only sounding good, but they last much longer than most I've tried. I have no problem with the connection it's like lightning speed."

Apple Charging Case,karissaj14,5,2024-04-04,"It is super convenient to charge this case when you have the free time, but it's not always convenient to charge when you're on the go. The Apple charging device has made it very convenient for people who were always on the go. Especially a busy mom like myself."
Sound amazing but Slip n' Slide,Y,3,2024-04-04,"The sound quality incoming and outgoing is amazing but since there isn't a silicone ear piece (or similar) that helps hold the bud in place, any sudden movement can cause one or both to fall out. Not good."

Super good product will recommend to anyone,sayurim14,5,2024-04-04,Sound quality is very good the battery life is really good but maybe after a little while of having them for a very long time they may tend to die faster they comfortable just like any Apple headphones/airpods they are somewhat durable when they fall the won't break! They connect very fast just need to push a button and it's done!

Volume quality decreases over time,caitlynk35,3,2024-04-03,The right ear volume does not work well after having this product for some time. This product works very well with other Apple products but not great with other products or older Apple products.

AirPods are a staple,mrsamberporter,5,2024-04-03,"I use these nightly to drown out my husbands snoring and they are a life saver!!

Great for those on the go,mykaiyas,4,2024-04-03,These are great especially for students and traveling. The sound quality is consistent doesn't decline after extended use. I also enjoy how much use I get after a single charge as I usually go about a week without a recharge.

It's okay,amejia916,3,2024-04-03,"I was not very impressed of the sound quality. I thought it would be a lot louder but they sounded the same like the normal wired Apple headphones and after 20 minutes of working out and being all sweaty, my headphones started to slide off my ear. Connectivity was good though it connected to my phone right away and the material it's self seems like good quality. Overall o feel like you're just paying for the brand."
Pretty good.,dinosundercover,4,2024-04-03,These are pretty great. The sound quality is excellent. My only issue is that since I have small ears they are a little too big. They have a great battery life that lasts hours longer than any other earbuds I've used.

Great features but in need of more sizing,kaylarm,3,2024-04-03,"The one feature Apple has figured out that I have not seen other wireless headphones replicate reliably is the ability to sense when removed from your ear. The battery life starts out excellent but definitely dwindles with average use. My biggest problem with these is that they do not fit in small ears well so they hurt and fall out constantly. I know people say to get the pros, but I don't feel it's fair to be forced to buy the more expensive product just for it to fit when I'm not interested in any of the other features for the price point."

Lacking,mrsd2000,1,2024-04-03,Quality of this AirPods is lacking greatly. Beside the fact that they won't stay in your ear they are uncomfortable and cause pain. The sound quality was good for the first year. Now I the volume has to be on the highest level to hear anything. Save your hard earned money.
Apple AirPods,cassyl11,3,2024-04-03,I love the sound quality and noise canceling on the Apple AirPods better than any others. What I don't like is how they do not stay in my ears. Even just the slightest movement they fall out.

Fun until they're not,jessican320,4,2024-04-03,These worked well for about three years and randomly the left pod just started to disconnect even though they're fully charged. So maybe it's time for new ones?? Even though they are still in new condition.

Great but may be uncomfortable,yougotrossed,4,2024-04-02,"The sound is great! They are easy to pair with devices and they hold a charge really well. The only con I had with them was how they felt in my ear. I apparently need some cushioning in there bc they hurt my ears after long term wear. Other than that, they are great."
Not practical for long hours,tateanaj,3,2024-04-02,The sound quality is pretty decent can't really complain considering the type of headphones they are. They can be uncomfortable after a few hours but that's to be expected. They connect to my devices automatically and I've had them for two years and they haven't broken. My biggest complaint is the battery life. They can just die on you in a few hours even if the case is charged.

Great everyday fitness headphones,Andrea70959,5,2024-04-02,"(This review was collected as part of a promotion.) The perfect headphones for working out and going on walks. Paired with an iPhone, it's very convenient and does a decent job reading your text messages to you. I would just recommend not putting them in their case until at least 10 minutes after a workout.

Expensive headphones ; cheaper ones out there,dominiquec69,3,2024-04-02,"The sound of the AirPods are good; I like when you move the sound moves with you. I like the tap to skip function when listening to music. The battery life isn't bad but once you start using it more, of course the battery life goes down quicker . The buds just doesn't seem to comfortably fit my ears no matter which size I use; they are always falling out . I literally lost an entire AirPod in Jamaica on vacation while I was riding a bus . So I wasn't even moving and it just falls out ."
Apple AirPods 2nd Gen,Saurin11268,4,2024-04-02,"(This review was collected as part of a promotion.) I'm always gets amazed how apple creates the excitement with every product and AirPods is no exception. Really great quality and impressive performance each time you hold it.

Definitely will upgrade in future to their newest gen."

AirPods,Ashe,4,2024-04-02,"I have finally made the switch from wired headphones to AirPods. They arrived pretty quickly. What people should know about this product is that you cannot find individual AirPods meaning, if you lose one somewhere in your house or whatever, they need to be together. That is just the difference between these and the AirPod pros."

Great but may be uncomfortable,yougotrossed,4,2024-04-02,"The sound is great! They are easy to pair with devices and they hold a charge really well. The only con I had with them was how they felt in my ear. I apparently need some cushioning in there bc they hurt my ears after long term wear. Other than that, they are great."
They are not noise cancelating unlike the newer more kmproved technology airpod pros,aylint11,4,2024-04-01,They are pretty loud if sound is turned up to max. Sometimes they may have a problem connecting to your device. Their battery life lasts a pretty long time. About 2 days if the case is full charged. They are comfortable in the ear but may start to irritate your ear if left in for a long amount of time. And they last you a long time period until new ones are needed or wanted to be purchased.

Love these!!!,sidneyn6,4,2024-04-01,"I've been using the Apple AirPods with Charging Case for a few months now. These earbuds have truly transformed the way I experience music and stay connected on the go. First and foremost, the convenience of these AirPods is unbeatable. They seamlessly connect to my Apple devices the moment I open the case, and the setup was a breeze. I love how they automatically pause playback when I remove one from my ear and start again when I put it back in. The AirPods' ergonomic design, lightweight construction, and earbud shape make them comfortable to wear for extended periods. Battery life has been exceptional, easily lasting me through a full day of use."
Not just paying for the brand name!,ghoul_guts,5,2024-04-01,"Love my AirPods! My boyfriend was a staunch anti-anything Apple person, but now even he bought a set of AirPods!! They have great sound quality, super comfortable (which was important to him as he finds most other earbuds uncomfortable), and are super durable (he wears them everywhere, including doing lawn work!)."
Exactly as expected,sophiaw147,4,2024-04-01,Had these for many years. They have very strong durability and lasted through many accidental washes in the washer. They connect very easily and have nice connectivity. They have good sound quality and battery life and also fit comfortably in my ear.
Must have!,heatherr474,4,2024-04-01,"I love my AirPods, I originally purchased them form my children and stole theirs and feel in love! The sound quality is amazing and they fit perfectly in my ear.

Good quality but not the best.,wismello,4,2024-04-01,"I own the first pair of AirPods and the 2nd generation pros. The sound quality is ok and it's also comfortable. But if I had to chose between this one and the first gen, I would pick the AirPods 1st Gen!"
Okay headphones,faithb027,4,2024-04-01,The sound quality is pretty good. I wish they stayed charged longer and the connectivity distance was further. I wish they were a little smaller because they do hurt my ears over time.
Charges AirPods quickly,rbgthesecons,4,2024-04-01,The battery life of the AirPods and the case are quite good. The case charges the devices quickly. The sound is usually good though sometimes skips.

Durable,silviaandreaa,5,2024-04-01,"These headphones, despite being the oldest model of Apple's AirPods, have lasted quite a while. I've had mine for 5 years and they still work well. They've fallen in water and still work. They are comfortable to use, don't bother, and don't fall out of the ears. The battery doesn't last long currently, probably due to the device's age, but it's not too exaggerated. Also, they connect easily and quickly."

They have good sound and quality but also have issues,donnad159,4,2024-04-01,"Generally I like the Apple AirPods. They have good sound and connect well. I wish they came in colors other than white. I've found they don't stay charged very well and one size doesn't fit everyone. If you have a small ear opening, they are not very comfortable because the pod is hard plastic. And they are not waterproof! I learned this after one falling out of my ear into my grandchild's bath water."

Easy to use,earnestlyerin,5,2024-04-01,Very happy with these vs the older models. I liked the wires but these are just so discreet and tasteful. They also last a really long time and I'm able to use them for meetings without any issues with sound quality which is amazing. Very impressed with the ease of use and access.
Daily use earbud,frankq2,4,2024-04-01,"Amazing to use on daily, using it a lot to go to the gym and sound good compared to many other companies but I would say it needs a bit of touch of bass. They last quite a long time and easy to connect with my phone."

Great product,fashioned,4,2024-03-31,"Sound Quality: Despite their size, AirPods deliver crystal-clear sound with just the right balance of bass and treble. While they may not satisfy hardcore audiophiles, most users, like myself, appreciate their rich audio experience, especially with Apple's tweaks. Comfort and Fit: AirPods are incredibly comfortable to wear, thanks to their lightweight design and perfect fit. They stay snug during long listening sessions, and their wire-free design allows for hassle-free movement. Connectivity and Controls: Pairing them with my iPhone is effortless, thanks to Apple's H1 chip. Touch controls on the stems make managing playback and summoning Siri a breeze, though I occasionally miss having physical volume buttons. Battery Life: With around 5 hours of playtime per charge and quick charging capabilities, AirPods keep the music going for over 24 hours straight with their sleek charging case. Integration with Apple Ecosystem: AirPods seamlessly integrate with all my Apple devices, effortlessly switching between them and responding to Siri commands. They truly enhance the overall Apple experience."

Didn't receive airpods,daniel,1,2024-03-31,"I ordered my AirPods recently and waited the few days of shipping, I received the shipping box but no AirPods. The packaging that was around the AirPods was still in the box but the product wasn't there. I payed over $100 for them. I tried resolving the issue but I have to wait 24 hours before I can get it solved. I'm not sure whose fault it was but I know I am the victim of someone's crime."
They have great sound coverages/ noise cancelling and last pretty long.,alanih2,4,2024-03-31,"I recently purchased the Apple AirPods with Charging Case, and I must say, they have exceeded my expectations in every aspect. Firstly, the wireless connectivity is seamless. The AirPods effortlessly pair with my devices, allowing me to enjoy my favorite music and podcasts without any hassle. The range is impressive, giving me freedom to move around without worrying about signal loss. Secondly, the sound quality is exceptional. The audio is crisp and clear, with a balanced mix of highs, mids, and lows. Whether I'm listening to music, taking calls, or watching videos, the AirPods deliver an immersive listening experience. Additionally, the charging case provides great convenience. Not only does it keep my AirPods protected when not in use, but it also ensures they're always ready to go with its quick and efficient charging capabilities. The battery life is impressive, lasting me through extended listening sessions without needing frequent recharging. Lastly, the design of the AirPods is sleek and ergonomic. They fit comfortably in my ears, and I appreciate the touch controls for easy navigation. Plus, the integration with Siri adds another layer of functionality, allowing me to control my music and access information hands-free.

Sleek convenience,stephaniem640,5,2024-03-30,I love this charger because it will act as a power bank once your air pods run out of steam. Once you place the AirPods back in the case after they lost power they'll quickly regain charge. It's so convenient. I also like how there's a magnetic component that holds the buds in place in the case. I love the sound quality of the AirPods as well and use them every day

AirPod have mic issue,Delva,3,2024-03-29,Mic default
Good Quality,erich63,4,2024-03-29,My daughter purchased these for me a few years ago. The AirPods are easy to connect to my iPhone and have a decent amount of battery life. My biggest complaint is the buds can stop working without warning after a while. I had to replace the buds on different occasions during my first year. If you have Apple Careplus or a third-party plan like Asurion Home Plus or Best Buy Total Tech you are good if these fail. I had my AirPods for about 5 years before I moved on to the Beats Studio Buds.

Convient,ardijanam,3,2024-03-29,For a person who suffers from carpal tunnel it's great to have something wireless so I don't need to hold my phone constantly. I find them a little uncomfortable bc my ear starts to hurt after having them on for a while. The charge does hold which is great.
,Joy,5,2024-03-29,My daughter loves her new airpods
Most durable headphones ever,shanielg1,5,2024-03-29,I personally think that EarPods are the best headset ever made. The are durable and the sound quality and feaurures are incredible. They fit comfortably in my ears and the battery life is also wonderful. I charge them maybe once a week. I recommend them 100%
Good Quality,erich63,4,2024-03-29,My daughter purchased these for me a few years ago. The AirPods are easy to connect to my iPhone and have a decent amount of battery life. My biggest complaint is the buds can stop working without warning after a while. I had to replace the buds on different occasions during my first year. If you have Apple Careplus or a third-party plan like Asurion Home Plus or Best Buy Total Tech you are good if these fail. I had my AirPods for about 5 years before I moved on to the Beats Studio Buds.
AirPods,AndyB,5,2024-03-29,"Couldn't be happier. I ordered these around 7am and they arrived in perfect condition the same day later that afternoon. They were also $5 more expensive than refurbished AirPods off Amazon that I didn't receive for 2 weeks and ultimately canceled the order to order these brand new from Walmart. Great value, AirPods work great and exceptionally quick delivery."

Battery lifespan,Taylor73645,1,2024-03-28,(This review was collected as part of a promotion.) I have had to send these AirPods back twice due to the battery not lasting. It seems to be the R air pod not holding charge or the case not holding charge. Luckily I have apple care and was able to get them to have them replaced but I have not been impressed at all. I don't think I would buy them again. I use them to train for marathon running and nothing sucks more than going for a run with no music because they didn't charge

The best earbuds yet!,deaconc,4,2024-03-28,"These are the best earbuds I've used hands down. I practically live with my airpods in, the sound quality is amazing and they feel great in my ears, rarely falling out like so many other earbuds I've tried. My only complaint is that one airpod loses its charge way faster than the other one. But I can't live without these and recommend them to everyone!"
Work for what I need,tyeshab3,4,2024-03-28,Sometimes the connectivity has no issue. The sound quality does depreciate overtime. I have a hard cleaning them. The battery life does depreciate overtime.

My favourite pair of wireless earbuds yet!,Lia26435,3,2024-03-28,"(This review was collected as part of a promotion.) I love these AirPods (for the most part) and use them everyday! They charge very quickly and have great sound quality. However, there are a few downsides. Firstly, every so often, my charging case will start flashing and making obnoxious sounds for several days at a time before it stops. Secondly, sometimes the case doesn't charge both AirPods, so I end up only getting sound in one side after patiently waiting for them to charge. Lastly, they will not connect to my MacBook for more than a minute at a time. It constantly disconnects and the only device it consistently connects to is my iPhone. With all that said, I still would recommend them."

Pairing is effortless, and the automatic connection feature means I can switch between my iPhone, iPad, and Mac seamlessly without missing a beat. The charging case is compact and convenient, providing additional battery life on the go. I appreciate the quick charging capability, ensuring that my AirPods are always ready when I need them. Overall, the AirPods have exceeded my expectations in terms of performance, convenience, and sound quality.

Battery doesn't last,maggyj5,4,2024-03-28,Once they go I. Your ears it cancels out most noise. It almost sounds like the ocean. The only downside is that the charge doesn't last over a day so if you loose the charger you have to get a new one and have a plug near by. I had a long flight and the battery died before my connection.

It's Nice,jalesa,4,2024-03-27,The sound quality is okay after a while. The sound lowers when you've had them for a minute. The connection between phone and AirPods is great. Does it immediately. The battery could be better.
1st gen worth it,elliam1,4,2024-03-27,I bought the first gen off someone and they're still kicking! They glitch sometimes and I used to have problems with them not playing sound but for the most part they're good.

Noise canceling is well worth the upgrade!,bridgetf18,4,2024-03-27,"There are so many things I love about the Apple AirPods Pro 2nd generation. One of my favorite things is the noise canceling feature that can be turned on or off. So if you're considering buying air pods the upgraded noise canceling on AirPod pro and above is well worth it. I use them at night when I'm trying to fall asleep because they cancel out my husbands snoring. The sound quality is amazing, it is so clear and crisp. They pair automatically with your phone so set up is a breeze. Getting used to the controls on the stems are a little tricky but once you play around with them you can figure it out pretty quickly. My only complaint is that I have a little difficulty fitting them in my ears. I have very small ears so I had to use the smaller silicone ear tips and swivel them to get the perfect angle. They fit well after the adjustments. Getting them to fit well in your ears is important to get the most out of the noise canceling and sound quality."

They are amazing for not only listening to music but I also take calls on it bc I have a hard time hearing from the speakers of any iPhones I've had. I love how they automatically connect and they do stay in the ears. The price is very reasonable. My next pair will be the AirPod Pro bc I think they would be even better at staying in the ears and removing all outside noise. Highly recommend these
4/5!,biandbyeglam,4,2024-03-26,"I have had these for awhile. While they are an older generation, they have lasted a few years. The battery life is not great, and the sound quality is decent. I usually struggle to find ear buds that fit my inner ears, but these do so that's why I've stuck with them!"
Intro level AirPods for day to day,chloea247,4,2024-03-26,"I have the 3rd Gen AirPods, and they've been great for day to day. These are not the noise cancelling ones, and I do crave that sometimes! The battery life is great, and I like the sound quality. These sometimes have connections issues, but I just fully disconnect and reconnect and it's usually okay! I use them most for phone calls and listening to podcasts."
LOVE,samanthab1095,4,2024-03-26,Love these. The music quality is so good. and the battery lasts all day. They stay in my ears so well and can connect to any device almost. I've had these for three years and they haven't broken!!

It's an Apple product,boops089,4,2024-03-26,These run for a good 3 years and then they start to get wonky like any other Apple product. Sometimes the connection between phone and pods disconnect mid song or podcast and then the charging case runs battery quick.

Comfy and Effective,gwendolynm18,5,2024-03-26,"Apple Airpods were the best purchase I've ever made. I bought them for myself in 2019 and they are still working great without a scratch. Unlike other earbuds that I've used, Airpods are comfortable and don't make my ears sore. I like how easy it is to connect my Airpods to different phones, laptops and iPads as I go throughout my day. I charge my Airpods maybe every 2-3 days so the battery life is exceptional. I love this product!"
Worth the money,Lisa,5,2024-03-26,"I'm not the type of person who needs to have Apple everything. In fact, I've had several brands of headsets over the years and they did the job just fine. But I tried these after purchasing them as a gift for my spouse and understood the saying ‚Äúyou get what you pay for.‚Äù Have I been listening to music wrong all these years? YES. Is there that big a difference in the clarity and crispness of the voice of the speaker? YES. Does it feel like you're wearing earbuds? Amazingly NO. This is one purchase you won't regret."

Empty box! No product,Crystal,1,2024-03-25,Box was empty. I paid over $100 for my son some EarPods for his birthday. EarPods wasn't inside the box. Box was cut open on the side and covered up with a sticker
These work great until they don't.,kelseys288,3,2024-03-25,"They do the job. Not the best fit or sound quality, but the connectivity is convenient. After a year or so, the sound quality significantly declines, even after cleaning."
air pods,Heidi,5,2024-03-25,i ordered them thru walmart app and got them the next day. their a great pair of headphones.
Bad compared to newer gens,inexorla,3,2024-03-25,The sound quality was bad as you can still hear things around you. Battery life was horrid compared to the newer ones. The comfort was not comfortable at all as they were very bulky & annoying to have in your ear & fell out often too. Their connectivity was agitating for me as they were hard to get connected. However the good thing about connection is they pop up well once they're connected the first time. They did play music loud even though it was annoying still being able to hear around you.
Very great product,dominiquey1,4,2024-03-25,I love these AirPods! I love how they are t restricted by the cord and you can freely move around. The sound quality is great and to me the battery life is great as well. They don't break easily either
Fits in my pocket,,4,2024-03-25,"Modern look and advanced technology that easily fits in my pocket. Not hard to pair with iPad,iPhone etc. Works great for my needs and i probably would buy a new one next time"
,Cansu,1,2024-03-25,"They left my package at different adress and lost it. When I called, they said we can only refund it. 20 mins call, not solving my issue. Horrible!"

Very good quality ear buds.,gingerm35,5,2024-03-25,"I love Apple Earbuds. They are the best in good quality. The music sounds smooth. You can't hear anything around you when you're listening to the music They come in a few different colors and the price is just right.

Lemon or not??,Teresa,4,2024-03-25,I'm not sure if all air pods work like w but the ones I purchased come on automatically when I put them in my ears but if nothing comes on the phone for a while they cut off.
Good for the first few years,betsyp329,4,2024-03-25,"The first couple years I had the AirPods they were great! Super comfortable, fit easy to use easy to connect. The last few months I've been having issues with connectivity static in the right ear pod only and the battery on the case dying pretty quick. Could you see that it's time for a new pair but I would hope that after three years they would still be working very well. But that doesn't seem to be the case."
I LOVE my apple AirPodpros!,havenc7,5,2024-03-25,"I absolutely love my Apple AirPod Pro's! The battery life is really good plus the case charges them when they get low and you get 2-3 charges each time you charge the case! The sound quality is awesome as well, they even have an option for noise cancellation in the settings once Bluetooth is connected to them! Super comfortable as well with the newer design of silicon ear pieces that come in 4 sizes so you can have earbuds that fit your ears perfectly!"

Good airpods,,4,2024-03-24,"Good sound quality and fit well in my ears, they have never felt uncomfortable. But, they always connect to other peoples phones which I hate!!!"
Worth your money,vin22,4,2024-03-24,"I like it a love. First, the design how it fit to your ear and not hurt your ear is a big big point. It sounds smooth and have a little noise-cancling which is really nice. Battery last forever. Only one thing to think about that sometime the airpod just disconnect ny itself and you can hear anything, that'll happen a lot when you start connect it to too much devices. I dont recommend you connect it to so many devices to stop confusing the airpop itself, so can help it to work better."

wonderful product I love it,fatimae107,5,2024-03-24,"I recently purchased AirPods around Christmas , and I'm delighted with my purchase. The AirPods themselves are fantastic, providing a seamless and high-quality listening experience. These airpods are amazing to have. The sound is crisp and the music just flows through the speakers. There is no static. The charging case seems like it last longer. very easy to set up & use , this is my 2nd pair since my first i did lose . they've been my togo for travel & gym seshs & just overall everything . they don't fall out of my ear & i like my music loud so when i play it at 100% no one around knows. i had the pros & honestly i didn't like them . i know that they have other features & noise cancelling but im more of a simple gal & truly these have met my expirations & have worked for me for years . easy money for me to spend too ."

The sound revolution that fits in your pocket.,joybouy,5,2024-03-22,"Apple AirPods are a line of wireless earbuds that come in a variety of styles to fit your needs and budget. Here's a quick rundown of the different models: * AirPods (2nd generation): These are the most affordable AirPods, offering good sound quality and a comfortable fit. They're a great option for everyday use. * AirPods (3rd generation): These AirPods offer improved sound quality and a more secure fit than the 2nd generation model. They also feature sweat and water resistance, making them a good choice for workouts. * AirPods Pro (2nd generation): These AirPods offer active noise cancellation, which means they can block out external noise. They also have a Transparency mode that lets you hear your surroundings when needed. AirPods Pro are the most expensive option, but they offer the best features and sound quality."

Overall better than the pros,zelley95,3,2024-03-21,"I prefer these over the pros. They do not fall out of your ear or hang up on people. I am switching back because they are less sensitive. Over all, they haven't broken yet even though I lost the left leg ear. The battery life is less than the pros."
lovely headphone,oliviah08,5,2024-03-21,the sound quality is great. the battery life is very long lasting and the comfort is very comfy the durability is high i have dropped mine many times and they are still like brand new the connectivity to your phone is very fast and i have no problems connecting them to my phone.
Long battery life,bella_if,4,2024-03-21,"I love love love my airpods!! They have great sound quality, a long battery life, they're comfortable, super durable, and always connect to my iphone very easily."
Great sound!,DawnBN,5,2024-03-21,I bought these for my daughter's birthday. She requested this pair over another brand or over the Apple AirPod Pro.
Highly recommend for their comfort and quality...,bonniew64,4,2024-03-21,"Sound quality is great and simple to connect, very comfortable to wear. The battery life is outstanding, with the charging case being durable."
My fav!,kyleight,5,2024-03-21,These are my favorite wireless headphones. I have an IPhone so having Apple AirPods just make sense. I have small ears and these fit and are comfortable. I can hear my music very well even without having them in full blast. I do normally only use one AirPod at a time so if one dies then I have the other. But they do take a while to charge.
Long battery life,bella_if,4,2024-03-21,"I love love love my airpods!! They have great sound quality, a long battery life, they're comfortable, super durable, and always connect to my iphone very easily."

"Quality sound, amazing battery life",robz1,5,2024-03-21,"Comfortable to wear on long calls and airport are durable as I have dropped them a number of times. They sound clear on calls and battery life has never been an issue, lasting days without charging. Connecting to different phones is easy and then once connected, swapping is easy."

Pretty good charging,goldennd,4,2024-03-21,"The AirPod charging case to me charges pretty fast and I feel like the battery life is pretty long lasting considering not necessarily having to charge it every single day. The AirPods itself are pretty comfortable, sometimes I forget that I have them in my ear lol"
Excellent for the Price,JM,5,2024-03-20,"This is my second pair of AirPods in 5 years. I was waiting for Black Friday to buy a new pair. Walmart had an excellent deal that I couldn't pass up. The build quality is good but the sound quality is average. I recommend paying the premium for the pros if you're looking for better sound quality and noise cancellation. However, these are great for everyday use and pair well with an iPhone. Apple's OS is good at seamlessly integrating their products. Only downside is the lack if waterproofing for the second or even third generation but again not necessarily a dealbreaker."
AirPods are unparalleled and invaluable,caseyc187,5,2024-03-20,"Apple AirPods offer a seamless audio experience with their sleek design, impressive sound quality, and effortless connectivity. The compact charging case provides convenience on the go, while the intuitive controls and hands-free Siri access enhance usability.Charging is easy and fast and can be via wire or wireless connections. For those immersed in the Apple ecosystem, AirPods are the perfect wireless companion."
holy grail,lilyb327,4,2024-03-20,These are a necessity every day to help me focus. The sound is good but after awhile you need to clean them. Durability is good just don't lose them lol. Battery Life goes a little quick but charges fast. Connects good.

Great option for portable earbuds,natalieirrenee,4,2024-03-20,"I had my AirPods for about three years. They were perfectly very easy and portable to use the battery was pretty good. The sound quality is good as well but I realized on my third year I needed an upgrade. The battery kind of died pretty quickly, and the speakers were kind of dying down."
"Just alright, doesn't stay in my ears",ngan17,4,2024-03-20,"I love Apple product and this one is good but it doesn't stay in my ear and way too sensitive. My phone conversation is often cut off because if I try to adjust this, it turns off. I won't be buying this again."

Best earphones I've ever owned,thud12,5,2024-03-20,"The design of this Apple Airpods 2 is so beautiful, they're lightweight and comfortable to wear. Battery Life is good enough for everyday use. I think Apple did a great work with active noise cancelling, there is also good separation between the highs, mids, and lows. This AirPods work so seamlessly with my other Apple products, it connected to my other apple devices quickly and effortlessly. The touch-sensitive interface offers straightforward and easy control over services like calls, music, and other items."
Good for the price,Eli,4,2024-03-20,"Not the best sounding earbuds on the market. Bass is weak, noise cancellation is non existent. However, for the price, the sound quality is decent and the range is great. The case is sleek and charges quickly."
,Monica,5,2024-03-20,They work really good I love them and so does my fiance I would recommend
Good not Perfect,joseleo426,4,2024-03-20,"Seamless integration with fellow Apple products and high quality, but short shelf life. The sound quality is great for the first year or so, then you may encounter balance issues between the right and left pod. Same goes for the battery life, becomes underwhelming after the principle year. But all in all a very good and dependable product, not perfect yet though."
Apple,anac672,2,2024-03-20,"The airpods are of good quality, but they are very small to me because you can lose them when you are traveling or when you are going somewhere and they are very expensive for you to lose them. I think it is better to spend on larger ones so that you do not lose them."

Reliable,zoeym50,4,2024-03-20,"I got these headphones almost four years ago and they are just as good now as they were then. I am a big headphone users so having wireless headphones where I didn't have to worry about carrying my phone and the cords was amazing. I will say it might just be because they are old, but if I wear them so an extended amount of time I get a headache."
Great Product,jadaa2,5,2024-03-20,Our kids LOVE Apple AirPods. And as with anything they are prone to be lost or accidentally washed. We have tried other brands when that happens and always go back to Apple. The sound quality is unmatched as is the battery life. They are comfortable and durable.

Apple AirPods,valenjyt,4,2024-03-20,"With typical usage, your AirPods will last for around two or three years, and the cause of most failures is the lithium-ion battery. This length of time coincides nicely, for Apple, with their general two and a-half year product cycles."
Great Apple product.,nikop5,4,2024-03-20,Great sound quality and long battery life. Durability and connectivity are great. Comfort is really important to me and I love my AirPods and Apple devices.
Great!,anneliesem8,4,2024-03-20,"Love these headphones, they get the job done, and they fit fine in my ears, the only complaint is if you're someone who wears headphones for a long time you do get that weird achy feeling in your ear. Otherwise sound is good half the time I forget, they're even in my ears! They also have connectivity from pretty far so I can walk around the house And get things done while I listen Ôøº"
Exceeded my expectations!!! Buy them!!!,hannahdougls,5,2024-03-20,"I am so impressed! I have a very difficult time getting earbuds to stay in my ears because my ears are small and these not only stay in, but sound amazing! I love the noise cancellation feature and that you can also turn on conversation awareness!! I had no idea these had so many capabilities when I first purchased them. Battery life is great as well. Buy them!!!"
Not a good fit,staciedfrey,3,2024-03-20,"I love the fact that they are wireless but these were awful in my ears, they were not a good fit and I ended up loosing one, because of it coming out! They are alot of money to not fit well."
Just Okay. No support.,Ashley,3,2024-03-20,They do not fit in the ear very well and they need some sort of support for people with smaller ears.

The Apple EarPods are the best. They are lite weight and fit comfortably in the ears. Sound quality is excellent. The Bluetooth connection to my phone and tablet is quick.,vinhc4,4,2024-03-19,"I've had them for 2 weeks now and I can definitely say they're amazing, they sound great, they connect easily, I love the design of them and the case, they're very comfortable, and they're pretty cheap I definitely recommend them if you don't really need noise canceling or the silicone ear tips. Also I recommend the ljusmicker case for them, it has a lot of color options and comes with a cleaning pen for the AirPods and charging case"
WORTH IT,Camillia,5,2024-03-19,I got them as a gift for someone. They love them! They connected perfectly fine to iPhone and work well. 2nd Generation AirPods are great.
Best bang for your buck!,Big4Momma,5,2024-03-19,"The 2nd generation AirPods are, hands down, my %231 pick when purchasing for my teens. This decision takes into consideration overall sound quality, comfort, battery longevity, and price. Other generations may tout slightly superior sound (can you REALLY tell?) but are they as comfortable and do they hold a charge for as long? These are durable - living through sports practices, trips to the beach and days at the river (and who knows what else). With the Find My Phone feature, we were able to quickly locate them when my teen left them at a friend's house. I simply don't have anything negative to say."
Not secure enough for heavy activity,debbies73,3,2024-03-19,I did have these put they didn't feel secure enough in my ears if I was doing chores outside. I lost one in my horse pasture and went with a different type

Good sound and perfect with an iPhone,johnk43,5,2024-03-18,AirPods work so smoothly and efficiently when paired up with an iPhone or other Apple device. The battery life seems to be pretty good for all day use with a full charge on the case. These AirPods work well for many uses and I even like them for high intensity running workouts.

After a while sometimes the sound can get quiet but not that bad,kath108,4,2024-03-16,I Love my AirPods the sound is great on them! They will stay charged for hours and they are so comfy in my ears. I have dropped them so many times and they still have held up great!

Hands free hearing!,stephtayl0r,4,2024-03-16,"The earbuds are fabulous for hands free hearing on long calls with friends or work purposes. The length of durability is good, about 2 hours max. Often times after a period of time you will hear static. A simple reset does the trick."
Apple Air Pods 2nd Gen,NickiInTX,5,2024-03-16,"I bought the Apple Air Pods 2 from Walmart and so glad i did. They were brand new, delivered to my door and best part‚Ä¶Wolly had the best price after searching for an hour. Very happy with purchase. They do hurt my ears if the pods stay in for too long. But that's expected. Hopefully Apple will change that soon."

Good,jessicaf847,3,2024-03-16,"The battery life is a very decent amount of time, it lasts me over 3 weeks but I don't use long times at all.

Long lasting & good sound quality,giselv1,4,2024-03-15,"I've had my 2nd generation Airpods for about 5 years now, and they are still good. They have nice sound quality and they connect well with my other Apple devices. When I first got them, I remember the battery dying and being almost fully charged in 5 mins, which now takes about 10. They do last hours before needing to charge again."
Great,breh16,4,2024-03-15,Nice ear buds to use! They are compact and not noticeable when you're out and about. The noise and quality is great. They are small and easy to lose or fall out though so that always makes me nervous

If you want low priced earbuds these aren't for you.,royc14,4,2024-03-15,These earpods have a good sound compared to other earbuds. The battery life is great and will last longer than the phone battery so you can charge both at the same time. They fit well in my ear without falling out. Over all I think they are a bit overpriced for what they are.
Not superior,jessical16,3,2024-03-15,Apple AirPods have not held up for the price you pay for them. They cost more than any other brand without the comfort or the quality. They do have a good battery life and the connectivity is decent.
Great sound and incredible noise reduction,elzarai,5,2024-03-15,"The other day I ordered headphones for my husband. This is the best gift for a loved one.

Pricy but worth it!,regisa,4,2024-03-15,AirPods are surprisingly good headphones and a significant step up from skullcandy and other cheaper ones. The battery lasts longer than I'd expected and they charge quickly. They're a little on the pricy side but I think worth it if you listen to music or podcasts often. Can't be beat for workouts.

Radiation is real!,franchescaf9,3,2024-03-14,"While these are convenient, my concern would be with the research regarding radiation exposure over time and potential harm to the body. I'll admit they can take a beating. For example I was bending over the sink and dropped an entire bud in water. After allowing it to dry for several days they began working like new. I absolutely love using them in s pinch but I am trying desperately to get wired again."
Good,ario10,4,2024-03-14,Battery life is good on these earphones. To me they aren't comfortable but to others in my family they are. They are easily connected to our Apple devices.
Travel friendly!,hannahp311,4,2024-03-14,These are nice to have for traveling or on the go. Definitely get a keychain or bulky case for them because you will lose them. They connect pretty easily and are fairly comfortable. The battery life isn't the greatest but they charge super fast.
"Pocket fit, battery last for a week, great sound quality",nhup16,5,2024-03-14,I've been used this AirPod more than a year. Battery stills last for couple days. I used it more at work.

Apple AirPods are great!,hannahm512,4,2024-03-13,The sound of apple AirPods is amazing. They stay charged for 2 days and are super comfortable in my ears. The only thing I can complain about is that I wish the AirPods themselves had tracking because sometimes I misplace them without the case near by.
Great quality & affordable,valerias284,5,2024-03-13,Like the quality of the actual product the sound is really impressive. There are AirPods that reduce background noise which makes this unique as they are small and not very noticeable. The battery life can last up to 3-4 days depending on how long you use them for. I def recommend these or the pros.
Amazing sound,ashleyl557,5,2024-03-13,"The most comfortable earbuds I have ever worn. They slide in my ears with ease and stay put until the end of my workout. The silicone ear piece provides a comfortable fit, and the sound is excellent. My favorite feature is the sound cancellation. The moment I get these in my ears, everything in the background fades away. I am able to use these two-three times before I need to recharge them. Well worth the money!"

Apple got this one right,marka57,5,2024-03-13,Apple only makes great products and this is no exception. Easy to connect. Good battery life. Bluetooth doesn't impact the sound quality as best I can tell and they are more comfortable than over the ear headphones. I use mine everyday for calls or music while exercising.
Likable product,Eboni,5,2024-03-13,"Like the product, hurts my ears a little bit because my ears are small."
AMAZING!,sydneyk106,5,2024-03-13,I loved my air pods and take them everywhere with me. It's easy and theres no wire connecting to my phone. It makes life easier and they sound incredible.

Batter life was not long,cassandrad146,2,2024-03-13,"I am not a fan, they never connect and battery life is so short. Sound quality was good and they were comfortable and durable but I would not recommend."
üëçüèΩ,essencel5,4,2024-03-13,"First and foremost, the sound quality is simply outstanding. The AirPods deliver crisp, clear, and immersive audio that brings music, podcasts, and movies to life. The balance of bass, midrange, and treble is perfectly calibrated, ensuring an enjoyable listening experience across a wide range of genres. Whether I'm rocking out to my favorite tunes or engrossed in an audiobook, the sound reproduction is flawless."
Always using these,kmartens,5,2024-03-13,"I recently purchased the Apple AirPods and I have been extremely impressed with their performance. The sound quality is excellent, with clear highs and deep bass. The wireless connectivity is seamless, allowing me to easily switch between my devices without any hassle. The battery life is also impressive, lasting me several hours on a single charge. I love the convenience of the AirPods, as I can simply pop them in my ears and they automatically connect to my phone. The touch controls on the AirPods make it easy to adjust the volume or skip tracks without having to take out my phone. The design of the AirPods is sleek and modern, and they are incredibly comfortable to wear for extended periods of time. I also appreciate the included charging case, which keeps my AirPods protected and charged up when I'm on the go. Overall, I highly recommend the Apple AirPods to anyone in the market for a high-quality pair of wireless earbuds. They are worth every penny for their exceptional sound quality, seamless connectivity, and convenient design. Last. And most importantly. I've put them through the washing machine and embarrassing amount of times and they still work great."

Great battery life,chaib3,5,2024-03-13,"I have been using these airpods for close to three years and the quality is excellent.

Best sound,cinthia_dosamples,4,2024-03-12,"These headphones are fantastic for studying or taking calls on the go. I recently misplaced a pair I'd just bought and was really bummed, so I got another set! I can't imagine life without them now. They effortlessly connect via Bluetooth and fit snugly in your purse, bag, or backpack. They even come with a charger, though you'll need a block to use it. I'd suggest getting a case when you buy them to keep them attached to your bag or any zipper."
Confort,claudiaa2,5,2024-03-12,I love them I'm not very big on headphones but these are awesome specially while I'm at work and I have to answer my kids. They are comfortable and don't bother my ears at all. I normally just wear one and it works wonders. Their u battery lasts a long time as .
"Handy, but not durable",mariag833,4,2024-03-12,"I tried to love them and still use them because they come in handy. BUT they stopped working shortly after the 1st year. The battery slowly started decreasing and now I'm at the point where my right AirPod doesn't last more than 1 minute. The other one still lasts, 2-3 hours max. I'm not sure if it's just my experience, but durability was low."

Great product just don't forget to charge them!,santanaf6,4,2024-03-12,"Connectivity is simple and fast. They are comfortable and the sound was perfect for me. Based on your use, battery life could be worked on though."
Super Affordable and Easy to use!,selenan10,4,2024-03-12,This AirPod sounds really good. It's easy to carry out of the all the other generation. The batter last the whole day if I switch them up. It also connect to the device really fast. Only minus point is easy to broke if I dropped it.
"Handy, but not durable",mariag833,4,2024-03-12,"I tried to love them and still use them because they come in handy. BUT they stopped working shortly after the 1st year. The battery slowly started decreasing and now I'm at the point where my right AirPod doesn't last more than 1 minute. The other one still lasts, 2-3 hours max. I'm not sure if it's just my experience, but durability was low."
Wonderful,Teressa,5,2024-03-12,These are FAR better than I expected! You can hear the other person more clearer compared to the other ear pods. Truely love ‚Äòem!!
Great sound,zachm29,4,2024-03-12,They sound very great while sitting on your ears very comfortably. They have a long battery life and connect to your phone very easily while also being very durable and can take lots of ware and tear.
,Johniya,5,2024-03-12,"Amazing purchase, very loud and can cancel out any background noise and alerts you when it's too loud to the point where it damages your hearing."
Great service,Federico,5,2024-03-12,Very good service and very fast delivery
I totally recommend,naimac12,4,2024-03-11,I've had my AirPods for about 3 years and it still works perfectly fine easy to connect it doesn't hurt the ears sound quality is good and the battery life is long
Worked good until they didn't,lexusw14,3,2024-03-11,Loved these headphones but one stopped working after only just a few months.. I got them for free with my Mac computer so apple would not send me a new pair.
Apple AirPods,StaceyS,5,2024-03-11,Excellent product. They are as described and price was very reasonable for them.
Turning into team iPhone,Jazz,4,2024-03-11,Bought these bc I needed them that day for something and it came through and connected perfectly with no issue! Only reason it has a 4 star review is bc why would Apple give me a charger for them with a USB end instead of the C end like everything else.
Good product,courtneyy35,4,2024-03-11,The sound quality is always good. Good comfort level and fits well in the ear. The battery life sustains about the same as other ear buds. The connectivity is really good. The durability is good.
Love the noise suppression,kylerk4,5,2024-03-11,"I love the sound suppression that the AirPods give as well as their battery life I believe they have a lot better, audio quality, and battery life than the previous version. They are highly durable and water resistant as I have dropped them in puddles of water, and been able to use them afterwards.Ôøº"
Pretty good!,carries74,4,2024-03-11,"I had a hard time getting these to stick in my ears. The plastic is sleek and smooth but man, they fell out all the time. I ended up buying rubber pads to go over the head which feels like I shouldn't have to buy something additional when I spend this much on a product but it is what it is. Good sound quality though!"
new and arrived fast !,maria,5,2024-03-11,they're authentic apple airpods new and arrived quick i love it
Connectivity still needs improvements,sharifs2,4,2024-03-11,"The quality of sound is good, however the connectivity is poor. I have to go to settings and pick AirPods almost every time I try to use them. They are automatically detected by iPhone, but not automatically chosen as default speakers/headphones."

Good product!,jamiech,4,2024-03-11,I loved using these. They are great to be hands free or to listen to music while home or out and about. At some point it stopped working and allowing people to hear me but I could hear them so I gave 4 stars. They are also pretty hard to clean!
Noise canceling,vyt14,4,2024-03-11,Noise canceling is amazing. No need to say more about The sound quality of Apple products we all know. Only one thing bothers me is that it sometimes falls out of my ear

Best AirPods,lorenzoh7,5,2024-03-11,"The Apple AirPods (2nd Generation) have been a total game-changer for my daily life! As a long-time Apple user, I finally decided to invest in these wireless earbuds, and I couldn't be happier with my purchase. First and foremost, the convenience they offer is unparalleled. The seamless pairing process with my iPhone was effortless, and they automatically connect as soon as I place them in my ears. I love the way the music automatically pauses when I remove one AirPod, and resumes as soon as I put it back in. It's such a small detail, but it makes a world of difference in my listening experience. The sound quality of these AirPods is fantastic. The audio is clear, crisp, and surprisingly rich, even in bass-heavy tracks. I'm genuinely impressed by how well they deliver music, podcasts, and calls, providing an immersive experience whether I'm working out or simply commuting. The wireless design is another aspect that I adore. The freedom of not having to deal with tangled wires or constantly readjusting earbuds during a workout is liberating. They fit comfortably and securely in my ears, even during intense activities, and l've never experienced any discomfort. The battery life is excellent as well. With the included charging case, l can easily extend the playtime throughout the day without worrying about running out of power. The case itself charges quickly, making it ready for use whenever I need it. As someone who frequently uses Siri on my iPhone, the seamless integration with these AirPods is a huge plus. The hands-free access to Siri is incredibly convenient for changing tracks, adjusting volume, or simply answering calls without reaching for my phone. I also appreciate the lightning charging feature. It aligns perfectly with my other Apple devices, and it's one less cable to worry about when traveling or charging on the go. One minor downside is that the AirPods are relatively expensive compared to other wireless earbuds on the market. However, the quality, performance, and user experience justify the investment for me. In conclusion, the Apple AirPods (2nd Generation) have exceeded my expectations in every way. The seamless connectivity, top-notch sound quality, comfortable fit, and convenient features make them an indispensable accessory for any Apple user. While they may be on the pricier side, l believe they are worth every penny for the unmatched experience they provide. I highly recommend these wireless earbuds to anyone looking for a superior listening experience and ultimate convenience on a daily basis!"

It's good but I prefer the airpod pro would be more noise canceling,linhng417,4,2024-03-11,This one is okay when I firstly bought it but I prefer the airpods pro with the better noise canceling. During the flight I cannot sleep without these pairs.
One of the best wireless earbuds,nicy,4,2024-03-11,"I have used airpods for 4 years. This is my second pair because the first pairs battery became poor. Overall an easy and comfortable earbud experience. Doesn't hurt my ears, instantly connects to my phone and iPad. The sound quality is not bad."
They're just not noise cancelling,peachishelly,4,2024-03-11,"The sound quality is just as every apple device- pretty crisp and clear! The battery life is insane- lasting me up to 3 days on a full charge, they're so comfy you forget about them after a while."
"These are durable, and an excellent choice!",awood816,5,2024-03-11,"Diesel earbuds are great! They are no match to the generic brands you can get for far cheaper. So, when it comes to spending the money, it ends up being worth it to purchase the Apple brand. And the battery life is quite long, however it's even longer on the pro. My husband has had several pairs of these and he loves them. The only downside is that they are hard to keep track of. It's easy to lose one little earbud. They definitely are durable though, we lost an earbud out in the yard and it was out in the elements for a couple of weeks before it was found.Ôøº"
Stable product that is efficient,angieh210,4,2024-03-11,"The sound quality is good but the battery doesn't last long. They are comfortable and stay in place, the find my feature is not accurate. It will only show where you last opened the case or used them."
Work great,Bethany,4,2024-03-10,Only problem I have is the case will not charge on my block I had to get a different one. They would charge the actual AirPods tho so it's weird. Once I got that figured out no complaints.
The most practical pair of headphones you own,gabrielaf136,5,2024-03-10,"The convenience of private sound at your fingertips. I love the simplicity of this product connects instantly to my phone. They sound amazing, they like almost never die comfortable fit to the ear and listen to music for hours I don't know if there water resistant but I've definitely put them in the washer and they still work, so A+ for durability. these might not be the most spectacular headphones but they get the job done and amazing quality for the price.Ôøº"

Apple AirPods are the best headphones. Great quality!,ralphb9,5,2024-03-10,"Apple AirPods redefine the wireless audio experience with their seamless connectivity, impressive sound quality, and sleek design. From the moment you open the case, they effortlessly pair with your device, providing you with a hassle-free listening experience. The sound quality is exceptional, delivering clear highs and deep, rich bass that immerse you in your music, podcasts, or calls.

,WalmartCustomer,5,2024-03-10,"I ordered a new pair of AirPods because I lost my original pair at school. I was expecting to spend a lot of money on the new pair, but was pleasantly surprised with the sale that was on them. The AirPods are great, and I'm glad that I purchased a new pair."
A decent headphone,laurenl482,4,2024-03-10,Worked as a great headphone option. They did not work well when working out and were not extremely comfortable as I have small ear canals. They did hold a charge well.
Trendy,carliag,4,2024-03-10,"Ôøº I believe that the quality of the AirPods sometimes are definitely overrated. Also, they can be really great purchase however, I will not see that there are the best."
A must have for music lovers,cassidyb100,5,2024-03-09,"I've always been the person who likes to listen to music every chance I get and growing up I went through sooooooo many headphones. They'd either break, get completely tangled or something else would happen to them. My fianc√© bought me these and I've never looked back. Having no wires makes it so you can listen while doing pretty much anything. The case stays charged for an amazing amount of time and it's super convenient that once you close that lid they're automatically charging so you know they'll be full powered and ready to go for the next use!"
Don't lose them!Ôøº,carissam47,4,2024-03-09,"great product. sound quality, battery life, comfort, connectivity‚Ä¶ all top tier. i just can't keep track of them lol. i lost about 2-3 sets üòïüòï"
AirPods,,5,2024-03-09,I always use AirPods as soon as I lose a pair I'll be the first to go to Walmart to buy me a new one because they have the best type of price at the end of the day and our good working quality. They don't break easily unless you lose them but other than that I love the AirPods
"Pay attention to them, if they fall out, almost impossible to find",leasa1971,4,2024-03-09,"I have had the ear buds for 2 years, battery life is amazing and the case recharges them quickly. I do like that I can plug the case in but they also charge if I set them on my wireless charging pad. The earbuds are comfortable when you are wearing them and don't hurt my ears."
Good for small ears,jennym52,4,2024-03-09,"I was scared to get these because I lose things easily. So far after 2 years I haven't lost them yet! The sound is pretty good, as someone who isn't picky about sound quality. I have small ears and they fit, but after a while they definitely get uncomfortable. T"
No,mindyholzer,3,2024-03-09,These I do not feel are comfortable and the way they store ear wax is gross. I prefer the beats for comfort and battery life. These are also super easy to loose

Great purchase!,Elyssia,5,2024-03-09,Got these AirPods on flash sale and love them! Not the latest version of them but still work just as great!
Good but‚Ä¶‚Ä¶,erinng3,4,2024-03-09,So the sound on this is excellent. The battery life is excellent. Only problem with these is my ears must be oddly shaped because I feel like they are always right on the edge of slipping out. I constantly have to push them back in‚Ä¶..
The most portable head phones ever,lauras1135,5,2024-03-09,"I absolutely love my AirPods, I do not know how I ever lived without them! They are so portable and comfortable to wear, they make listening to music and taking calls on the go so easy and convenient! They're also super fast to connect across all your devices, plus they charge extremely fast so having them die on you quickly has never been a real issue for me. Seriously can't be without them!"
Great sound quality,erikar171,5,2024-03-09,I have purchased several pairs of AirPods for my kids. They are great for working out at the gym. Listening to podcasts. Talking on your cell phone.

They do the job,sandraajay,3,2024-03-09,"Battery life's pretty good, don't find myself needing to recharge them very often but I do use them sporadically for a short amount of time but even without use they hold their charge which I like"

"Versatility. Works with gaming, phone calls, mini baby monitors, and more.",jonnatanc,5,2024-03-09,Since the day I've gotten my AirPods I can't live without them. They've been a great addition for me. The sound quality is crisp. I can go over a week with charging them. And I've had them for at least 2 years and still no change in quality. Definitely a great addition to anyone's daily arsenal.
Pretty good,mimis31,4,2024-03-09,"Pretty good. Charges just fine, sounds quality is good comfort is good. It's pricey but I guess that's how it is nowadays. It's been more than 2 years and it's just fine"

"Well rounded, will fall out",alliemyzinga,4,2024-03-09,They lasted me such a long time and through everything. The only qualm I have is that their original design falls out of your ears incredibly easy. The sound quality is great for an earbud and the lifespan was even better.

Great! üëçüèª,darrenm25,4,2024-03-08,These are the best headphones out there. The case battery lasts for days and the AirPods themselves last all day. They are very loud and have a good bass to them so anyone who's into music or podcasts will love them. They are comfortable in the ear and have yet to fall out compared to a few known headphone brands.
Meh,lyssiep,3,2024-03-08,"I'm indifferent about how I feel about these. Maybe I'm just too clumsy but I find I have a lot of issues with the AirPods falling out of my ear, when they start falling out and I try to catch them to place them back in my ear I ALWAYS end up turning them off accidentally. It becomes a bit annoying. I also don't feel the quality of the sound is any better that the Soundcore ear pods I had before these. In my opinion I think they just aren't worth the price or the hype"

"Good, not great",hopless_romantic87,3,2024-03-07,"I'll start by saying my family is BIG into Apple products, we own everything they've put out in the last decade ‚Äî although my relationship with their products goes back over 20+ years. I've purchased four pairs of AirPods, and two AirPod Pro's. In my opinion, they are definitely just ‚Äúokay‚Äù, they work as intended, but we've all had these fall out of our ears too many times. Sound quality is good but not great, and no where near as clean and crisp as the Pro series. Battery life is pretty generous, and although I purchased these for my kids, I personally would rather spend the extra on the Pro series for myself. They definitely are a great gift option for teenagers!"

Excellent price for black Friday sale,DeeDee,5,2024-03-07,My nephews love these. Great buy!
Okay and convenient,shakeeba,4,2024-03-07,"Obviously these are not a necessity but once I purchased these I found they are very convenient for switching between Apple devices or even just improved wire free mobility. They can get uncomfortable after a while because of the hard plastic material they are made of and once the case has no battery the AirPods are useless though they might show as having some battery left in each ear. They also happen to charge unevenly on occasion. Overall, okay if you can afford."

The charging case provides additional battery life on the go and extending usage time, so I can use it up to 24 hours of listening time. Although its open design might not isolate noise effectively in noisy environments, it is durable and a solid choice for those who are seeking a hassle-free wireless audio solution."
really good for price,haileyb214,4,2024-03-07,sound quality is good and they are comfortable. may fall out of ears when working out though. The battery life is insane as well. battery lasts for a long time. only flaw is after awhile the microphone may not work well.
Excellent price for black Friday sale,DeeDee,5,2024-03-07,My nephews love these. Great buy!
The best,Your,5,2024-03-07,They work amazingly I will never buy another kind of earphones
Good but tricky,kellyjeanqueen,4,2024-03-07,"I'm sure there's just a learning curve, but these are so touchy to use, if I have to adjust the way they're sitting in my ear, I end up pausing my music or skipping. I'm happy with the sound and other factors but for me, they're too responsive to being touched and they could be more secure fitting."
Easy to travel,christineb320,4,2024-03-07,I love how easy they are to travel with. Battery has a pretty good life. The sound is great but I feel it's wearing over time. They are comfortable but when you wear them for a long time they hurt my ears. Overall I like them
Perfect and simple,catherineh0306,4,2024-03-07,I loved these! For the simple design they were surprisingly noise cancelling for me. Very discreet so I could wear them with my hair down and nobody knew.
"Good, not great",hopless_romantic87,3,2024-03-07,"I'll start by saying my family is BIG into Apple products, we own everything they've put out in the last decade ‚Äî although my relationship with their products goes back over 20+ years. I've purchased four pairs of AirPods, and two AirPod Pro's. In my opinion, they are definitely just ‚Äúokay‚Äù, they work as intended, but we've all had these fall out of our ears too many times. Sound quality is good but not great, and no where near as clean and crisp as the Pro series. Battery life is pretty generous, and although I purchased these for my kids, I personally would rather spend the extra on the Pro series for myself. They definitely are a great gift option for teenagers!"
Work great,Linda,5,2024-03-06,Great sound.
Love it,Safiya,5,2024-03-06,Love them! The sound is clear and they fit so well! One of my favorite purchases.
Good purchase,Cole,5,2024-03-06,Works just fine and the battery lasts a good while!
Excellent,vanh20,5,2024-03-06,"I use the Apple AirPods to listen to podcasts and music anytime I don't want my listening habits to infringe on the space of others. The AirPods pair easily, are comfortable to wear, have excellent sound quality, and recharge quickly. AirPods are very well made and have all the niceties we've come to expect from Apple. Excellent product in ways to numerous to mention!"
Great for travel!,maeganw7,4,2024-03-06,"I love my Apple AirPods! The sound quality is great. Comfortable but not for long periods of time. The battery life is pretty good.

They last but will need to upgrade in a few years.,nykaylaw,4,2024-03-06,The sound quality is pretty nice with these. I've had them for a few years now and they're still kicking! Sometimes they don't connect right away so that's kind of a hassle but it's worth it. I also have small ears so sometimes they don't fit but I'm used to it.
Headphones are not afraid sweat and water The sensations are simply magical,nadiiad2,5,2024-03-06,"I bought these headphones a month ago, I am still very satisfied and consider this purchase very successful. Everything works perfectly and without complaints, good quality, the product is original . Excellent headphones. Do not fall out of the ears. Good sound quality and compactness. Up to 4 hours of talk time without recharging ."

Great choice for everyday use,nalanipatt,4,2024-03-06,I love my AirPods. I've had them for almost 6 years and they still work beautifully. One has lost some sound strength but i have put them through the wringer (and the washer) Abe they are still holding up. The charger light no longer works but they still connect to my phone. I don't know if they will make a new connection but they still connect to remember devices so i don't really care. They don't have much noise cancellation but i prefer to hear surrounding sounds day to day for casual use anyways
air pods,Vee,5,2024-03-06,I bought these for my son and he loves them!
Good for price,oliviar406,4,2024-03-06,"The sound quality is pretty good for the price, the AirPods fit comfortably in my ears, the case isn't entirely durable and sometimes doesn't charge both AirPods at the same time"
Always reliable,adriang103,5,2024-03-06,"Apple can never do wrong with products I have been a fan of the air pods since it's release date, I had great sound, battery life and has always been my go to product for reliability, it has easy to connect and have always been comfortable to wear and have always been durable."
Great device,vanessa34130,4,2024-03-06,"I want to love my AirPods, but I guess because of my ears in particular they are very small. I have a hard time trying to keep it in my ear most people I know don't have this issue so it's obviously bearing depending on the user one thing I do know that the noise canceling level is amazing and the sound clarity when it is in my ear is great as well. The price is decent although I wish they would go a little lower especially because there are knock offs out there that look very similar that sound just as good as well but of course you're paying for a brand and the reputation behind the brand."

Didn't last,daniellep380,3,2024-03-05,"I have smaller ear canals and they were comfortable enough. However, I didn't use them very often and after two years they just put out a static noise (which I found out was a problem with them and they would replace after the fact). I went with a different brand after that."

How long they last,mercedesp64,5,2024-03-05,"I would be happy to help you with that. How about this: I cannot agree more - these headphones are truly remarkable! I have been using them for quite some time now, and I am amazed at how well they have held up. The build quality is top-notch, and they still look and function like brand new headphones. I must say, I am thoroughly impressed with their durability and longevity."
Great earphones for every aspect of life!,courtneyh466,4,2024-03-05,"I use these headphones on a day to day basis. Whether it's in the gym, at work or listening to an audio book! My only dislike is the battery life isn't fantastic, but it's a small dislike for how great they are!"

That's wonderful! Enjoying music through headphones can enhance the musical experience. What type of music is your favorite?,lilia_rdi,5,2024-03-04,"AirPods are impressive! They connect instantly, deliver high-quality sound, and are incredibly convenient to use. The comfort factor is noteworthy, making them a well-rounded choice. However, the price point might be a bit steep for some, considering the alternatives. Overall, the seamless integration with other Apple devices makes it a worthwhile investment for many."

Good!,Donavan,5,2024-03-04,Nothing wrong with the product
Worth a try,brittanyl278,4,2024-03-04,These AirPods are great. The battery life was great when I first got them years ago. Just like with anything else as time passes the battery life weakens. I normally prefer the left ear over the right. And the left ear seems not to last as long anymore. I dislike how when they are dying there's no time warning. Just a quick sound then automatic off. A warning notification with some time before powering down would be great!! The connection distance is great. They are also comfortable. In my ears they don't seem as secure but my left ear feels a little more secure which is why it's my preferred ear.

Stopped working after 2 months of use,,1,2024-03-04,"I purchased the AirPods in November 2023 for a Christmas present for my son. He opened them Christmas Day and has been using them daily, however at the end of February 2024 they stopped working and no longer would charge."
I would rate the product a 5/5! Great product.,stephenpt,5,2024-03-04,"I've used wireless ear buds before but none quite like Apple's AirPods they are light and don't try to fall or work their way out of the ear, the sound is immaculate, and it's just so good to be biking or exercising and not worrying about losing them on the ground or under a treadmill. ÔøºThen lastly is the battery life, it's insane to me that after a while almost 24 hours of use, if the AirPods are on 10% or less battery you can charge them again and in 15 minutes they are back to 90%."
Quality Earbuds,sarahv96,4,2024-03-04,"I love my AirPods because of the added flexibility they give me to walk away from my phone, but like many apple products, they can be glitchy, which is frustrating. Occasionally only one ear bud will work or one won't charge and there's no apparent reason why. The battery life is pretty decent and the sound quality is good for ear buds, but I think Apple could continue to improve these."

Gained my stamp of approval :),christinat229,5,2024-03-03,"Apple AirPods offer a seamless and truly wireless experience that revolutionize the way we all listen to music, make calls, and interact with our devices. I'm sure I'm not the only one that feels this way. From the moment you open the sleek charging case, you're greeted with the signature Apple simplicity and elegance. The AirPods effortlessly pair with your Apple devices, thanks to the H1 chip, ensuring a stable and reliable connection every time.

The hands-free ""Hey Siri"" functionality adds an extra layer of convenience, making it easy to access information, set reminders, and control your music without ever having to reach for your device. Battery life is impressive, with up to 5 hours of listening time on a single charge and the convenient charging case providing multiple additional charges on the go. The quick charging feature also ensures that you're never without music for long, with just 15 minutes in the case providing up to 3 hours of listening time. Overall, Apple AirPods deliver a premium wireless audio experience with seamless integration into the Apple ecosystem. Whether you're a music lover, a frequent caller, or a multitasker on the go, the AirPods offer unparalleled convenience, comfort, and sound quality that truly sets them apart. I love them and would recommend over and over to friends and family."
Does not stay in place!,glamimpression,3,2024-03-03,I despise my AirPods as they incessantly detach from my ears. It baffles me why Apple is incapable of producing AirPods tailored to accommodate various ear sizes. It is evident that not all ears conform to a single size.
I liked the old wired ones better,jaderon3196,3,2024-03-03,The battery life leaves a lot to be desired. It seemed alright at first but it has really went downhill. I don't even use my AirPods that much and it sucks. I would much rather use the wired ones that use to come with the iPhone.

Love my lovely AirPod,veed11,5,2024-03-03,"These wireless headphones are easy to connect to, and then you just take the out the case and you go on about your day, it's as easy as that. These headphones are comfortable, and stylish, and have a long battery life. I can go half my day with one of them on and just switch to the other one to finish off my day. The 3rd generation also has noise cancelation which can be perfect when you're in a noisy environment and need to focus on something, you can just put them on and boom. Another thing I like about this product is that the case charges them when you aren't using them. Because of this, I can have one on and one in the case so when the one I have on dies I just put the other one on and just keep going about my day. The AirPods also provide great audio and bass to add to it. Listening to music has become a big part of my daily routine and how I go about my day. These headphones provide that wirelessly and with great audio. To add to how great these headphones are, they are sweat and water resistance. Great for working out or going on a run, when I go on runs these headphones won't fall off either, even with the sweat. The water resistance also gives it a little relief with the extra protection barrier just in case you get a little water on it. I love this product and I believe it is worth the price. I know many people would enjoy this product as much as I do"
Love My AirPods,VettieVet,5,2024-03-03,"The sound is very good. Only issue is for some reason, the left one falls out often; but I know when it happens because they turn off.

AMAZING !!!,phuongle179,5,2024-03-03,"When you are a busy person who has to drive every day and your hands are always busy, it is a truly necessary device. You cannot drive and hold the phone to talk at the same time. it's really dangerous. And you also can't hold your phone while working. it's not professional at all. I always have to wear headphones when working, listening to music, the sound is great, the battery lasts a long time, I have used a lot of headphones but they hurt my ears very much. There are some that fall out without me even realizing it, but with the Apple AirPort, I'm very comfortable. It connects very quickly, and easily, and of course it is also very durable, it is not fragile, it is very durable. I really love it. You should try it if you have the chance. I know there are many cheap headphones on the market but you should remember ""you pay what you get"". You won't regret buying it."

Best purchase for myself thus far!!!,nhiy,5,2024-03-03,"held out for a long time and finally grabbed these because i needed to take a personal phone call at work (wothout being too obvious... an interview). These airpods are great! Airpods is a great headset, plus the convenient of being wireless, very good sound, less noise,, long life battery, easy to charge & fast, easy to pair on iphone, very sleek looking, lightweight. Really love it on my fitness activity. People can here you clearly using the microphone, they charge very quickly, the case is a portable charger. You won't get the cord caught in the vacuum handle or if you are on the treadmill! Just buy them already! i definitely recommend the product"

Good Wireless earbuds,oliviad4f25,4,2024-03-03,"I love my AirPods. They make listening to music and taking phone calls so easy especially while multitasking. They are super easy to connect to both Apple devices and other devices. They are small and compact which make them easy to carry around and take on the go. While I love my AirPods, I do have a couple of complaints. For one, weirdly one side will always die long before the other side. Another problem I have is that I have to be careful with my long hair. Otherwise, I will lose one or both in my hair, clothes or on the ground."

I went online and found a replacement case, but it cost more than just buying the entire thing. Win win!! I got a great price she got a new case AND an extra pair of AirPods"
The battery runs out petty quick but it charges just as quick.,nickf47,5,2024-03-02,"They have many great features, and they look great. Sound quality is a solid 10/10. works extremely well with spacial audio. I have dropped them many tumes and they just have a few scratches, but no other harm. great durability. They are an 7/10 in comfort, coule be better"
Everyday headphone,monicad214,4,2024-03-02,"The Apple AirPods with charging case are a testament to Apple's commitment to seamless integration and user experience. From the moment you open the sleek packaging, you're greeted with a sense of simplicity and elegance. The AirPods themselves are incredibly lightweight and comfortable, making them perfect for extended listening sessions. The sound quality is impressive, delivering crisp highs and satisfying bass despite their compact size. Pairing them with your Apple devices is effortless thanks to the H1 chip, which enables instant connection and reliable Bluetooth performance. The charging case is compact and conveniently holds multiple charges, ensuring that your AirPods are always ready when you need them. Plus, the quick charging feature provides an extra hour of playback with just 15 minutes in the case. While the lack of physical controls might take some getting used to for some users, the intuitive touch controls make it easy to adjust volume, skip tracks, and activate Siri with a simple tap or voice command. Overall, the Apple AirPods with charging case offer a seamless and enjoyable wireless audio experience that's hard to beat. Whether you're using them for music, calls, or accessing Siri on the go, they're a reliable companion for any Apple enthusiast."
Great Christmas Gift,MomoMama,5,2024-03-02,I brought these for Christmas for my best friend and she loves them of course it's a great product. Shoutout to Apple!. But thanks to Walmart for lowering the price a little for us!
Not very good,anhn98,3,2024-03-02,My husband bought this for me. I keep it carefully but suddenly the left side doesn't work. Connection sometimes is good but sometimes you need to do it manually. Battery doesn't last long too.
they can't hear me well,arrinay,4,2024-03-02,"I'll start the review with the packaging. very high quality box, made of hard cardboard. Inside the box there are documents and a charging cable. The headphones themselves are multifunctional with a touch button and automatic sound reduction and other functions. What I like is that the headphones always fall off my ears. I changed the size of the nozzles but they still fall off. Another disadvantage is that everyone complains that they can hear very little of me, as if from far away. And I like the headphones smooth sound with bass. I charge the case once a week or more, and the charge of the headphones themselves lasts for 4-5 hours."
Good sound and quality,isidorae4,4,2024-03-02,"Although the sound quality is good, I wanted these for running and ended losing one in the process. They aren't the best option for running or doing some sports"

"Great, and truly worth their cost.",YoursTruly,4,2024-03-02,"Sound quality is great. For the most part, battery life gets it done through one days average uses.

Okay,Leslie,2,2024-03-01,"I bought a pair a couple years ago, had to buy a new pair because the right AirPod stopped working. Now with my new pair the sound glitches in and out and they're only 2 weeks old. Sucks spending that much money and already having a issue."
Good Option But Not The Best,thedivinemissm365,4,2024-03-01,These are great and connect to your iPhone easily which makes it easier to track if they get lost or stolen but they tend to fall out of my ears more than I'd like them to. I also just don't find them very comfortable unfortunately.

I highly recommend them for daily life,planetary_no,5,2024-03-01,"I love the apple AirPods. I have gen 2 and they have a great sound quality and the battery life is amazing for how compact they are. I use mine everyday through the day, I only wish the had a longer charge then 4 hours but it's still a great time in my opinion. I had no issue paring them to my phone when I got them originally and they've worked great since day one, only downside is this disconnect after a certain distance; but same with almost all Bluetooth products."
Yes queen,anniek85,4,2024-03-01,The sound is so good and the battery life is so great. They're so comfortable in your ears and last a long time. They're very easy to connect to your phone.
It's okay,imnicooo,4,2024-03-01,"In my experience with Apple AirPods, I would give them a solid 4 out of 5. The seamless connectivity and impressive sound quality make them a go-to for daily use. The Siri integration is handy, and the design is sleek. While they're fantastic, there's a small room for improvement that would make them perfect for my personal preferences. Overall, a reliable and stylish choice for wireless earbuds."

Good but there are better now,michaho,4,2024-03-01,"Rarely use them anymore, as I'm just not out and about as much, but when I did I really liked them‚Äîexcept for at the gym. I am a runner, and not matter what I tried they would get loose and not sit comfortably. Even with attaching clips to them. Battery would last me a solid 12/14 hours or so before needing charged, but I only used them a few hours a day if that."

"Well, they're Apple.",youshouldcmeinacrown,3,2024-02-29,"I love everything apple. I have the iPad Pro, the Apple Watch , and have had i phones since 2014 . I even bought an Apple Pencil or two. The ear pods ‚Ä¶ I'm not thrilled with. They turn on and off on a whim. The power buttons are way too sensitive. They will turn on in my back pack, un renounced to me, and when I go to use them they're dead. They don't hold a charge for a super long time, and I don't feel like they're secure in my ears I feel like if I move my head to fast one way or another, they're just going to fall out. On the plus side, they're Apple. They have great sound quality, super simple to pair with I phone. Almost too easy. And they're compact. Comfortable wearing, super light weight and come with the case. Charge them with a lightning cable. Not water proof.. I gave 3 stars because it's Apple, and they rock when it comes to technology and the sound quality.. but Apple, Try harder. Better luck in the future. ,"

Amazing product,sabrinam438,5,2024-02-28,"Impressive Noise Cancellation and Sound Quality: A Review of Apple AirPods Pro The Apple AirPods Pro deliver an exceptional audio experience, coupled with impressive noise cancellation technology, making them a standout choice for wireless earbuds. From the moment you unbox them, the attention to detail is evident, with a sleek, compact design that feels premium. The key feature of the AirPods Pro is their active noise cancellation (ANC), which effectively blocks out external noise, immersing you in your music or calls. The transparency mode is also noteworthy, allowing you to hear your surroundings without removing the earbuds, which is great for staying aware of your environment. In terms of sound quality, the AirPods Pro offer a balanced and detailed sound signature. The bass is punchy without overpowering the mids and highs, providing a rich listening experience across various music genres. The adaptive EQ further enhances the sound quality by adjusting the frequencies to the shape of your ear for a personalized audio experience. Comfort is another area where the AirPods Pro excel. The earbuds come with three sizes of silicone ear tips, ensuring a snug fit for most ear shapes. The lightweight design makes them comfortable for extended wear, whether you're using them for music, calls, or even workouts."

After a few months right side doesnt work,awildav12,4,2024-02-28,They are good in the beginning. However after a few months the right side stopped working and now i dont have airpods. Gotta buy other ones. I would recommend the other ones.
Good quality product but advisepickinh Airpod Pros,baylied1,4,2024-02-28,These AirPods were great quality for the first two years I owned them. The sound was not the best quality when you're in a loud environment. Also they easily fall out of your ear.
Great quality long-lasting headphones for the price,ronnieh12,5,2024-02-28,"I received these headphones as a gift from my best friend and have been in love with them for going on 5 years. They charge well, and I am able to use them for hours off one charge. The sound is amazing, and you don't have to have them on the loudest volume to hear what you are listening to. They are light on the ear & extremely comfortable, so if comfort is something you worry about, these are definitely the headphones to go for."
"Good comfort, be careful",lilie10,3,2024-02-28,The sound quality was good but one of my earbuds broke very quickly and is barely putting out sound. They are comfortable and easy to connect. pretty solid battery life
Must-Have,moreneque,4,2024-02-28,"Sleek, stylish, and packed with power. With seamless connectivity, impressive sound quality, and all-day comfort, they're the perfect companion for my busy lifestyle. Now I wonder how I ever lived without them"

They are good,kjt7420,4,2024-02-27,"I liked these. I used them occasionally a few years ago, going for walks or sitting at home. These aren't the most comfortable but I purchased a separate set of buds you can attach on the ends to make them more comfortable. They have a good charge time, and decent sound quality."
They worked perfectly,Norma,5,2024-02-27,"Nothing to dislike, everything to love about them"
Very nice,tayiba_syed,4,2024-02-27,"The sound qualities on these are very good, but I do feel that after a while, they do die down same thing goes for the battery life. It's very well in the beginning, but does tend to deteriorate after a bit but overall comfort, wise and connectivity and durability. They are A1."
,Azza,5,2024-02-27,Perfect condition and excellent delivery time
I love it,lamn12,5,2024-02-27,"First and foremost, the convenience factor of the AirPods is unparalleled. The seamless pairing with Apple devices through the H1 chip ensures a hassle-free connection every time you open the case. The instant connectivity, coupled with the automatic play/pause feature when removing them from your ears, enhances the overall user experience. Sound quality is a standout feature of the AirPods 2nd Gen. The audio reproduction is crisp, with well-balanced bass and clear mids and highs. Whether you're listening to your favorite music, taking calls, or watching videos, the AirPods deliver an immersive sound experience that belies their compact size. The battery life is impressive, offering several hours of playback on a single charge. The convenience of the charging case provides additional on-the-go usage, and the quick charge feature ensures that a short charge delivers a substantial boost in battery life. This makes the AirPods an ideal companion for long commutes, workouts, or travel."
Great air pods,racheld52,5,2024-02-27,"These apple air pods are great, the sound quality is nice and the bass is also nice. They connect very easily using Bluetooth. They are very comfortable and do not fall out easily. I also love that you can track both air pods and ping them if lost. This product is great I would highly recommend them."
You wont be disappointed !,sergiom50,4,2024-02-27,"If you're always on the go and love to talk/listen to music , then these headphones are for you . They're easy to use and have a sturdy case which can go a long way. When I first received these as a gift, I was thrilled ! They fit easy in your ear and cause no discomfort. The battery life is good on the headphones/battery pack . The sound is loud enough for people who love to listen to loud music (like myself). I'd recommend these headphones ."
They worked perfectly,Norma,5,2024-02-27,"Nothing to dislike, everything to love about them"
"Good product, but faces durability issues",claudial276,4,2024-02-27,"I like the audio quality and the overall look of them. I really love all of the customizable cases you can get for them and the fact that when you drop them the airpods do not go flying out of the case. The battery life was really good when I first got them, but it is slightly getting worse over time like most apple products. Rocks and other grime easily get stuck in the case, especially on the little magnetic locks on the cap. Theres really no way to get rid of it either no matter how much you try to clean it."
They're AirPods,marissap154,4,2024-02-27,"These were great when they first came out. I've had mine for several years now and one is way quieter than the other. I will say they lasted a few good years! Easy to connect to phone. Easy to carry in pockets, small purses etc!"

Decent,lillys97,3,2024-02-27,This is the Apple AirPods with charging case and there are some pros and cons with these. The fit is generally good but I find it falls out quite a bit and I'm worried about losing them. The sound quality was very good at first but declines with time. It hold a nice charge but takes a while to recharge them. I like them but there is some room for improvement
Very useful and great sound quality!,maliad20,4,2024-02-27,"I love the fit of the second generation and how easy they are to use! Very beginner friendly introduction to wireless earbuds and the sound quality is great. I use them everyday when walking to classes or doing homework. The only downside is that they can be pretty easy to lose if you don't immediately put them back into the case. Overall, very useful and my favorite wireless earbuds!"

Not a long life,zakiyam3,3,2024-02-25,The sound quality was ok. Connected to the phone with no issues. Battery life dwindles after a few years. Durability isn't that great should put in a protective case. Comfort is average.

,Aaliyah,1,2024-02-24,Ordered the 2nd generation and they gave me the 1st generation. Didnt come the day it was supposed to . And got delayed until the next day.
AirPods Review,streamfire,4,2024-02-24,"I would recommend airpods, I have been using them for around 3 or 4 years. Definitely very convenient to use, I have ended up getting many pairs by now. The battery life is generally good, I haven't charged my current pair in 2 days and it's still running. They are mostly comfortable to sleep in, and the white noise function is very helpful for resting and relaxing. The only real complaint I have is the audio quality sometimes isn't the best, though usually it's an issue of the angle I'm wearing them. Also, they aren't very good for intense movement exercise, like running or biking, as they aren't held on strong enough to not fall out."

Reliable,mariana99,5,2024-02-24,"Initially, I was hesitant about purchasing AirPods because I wasn't sure I'd like them but I was wrong. I will typically charge my airpods before I begin my chores. I'm able to do 2 hours worth of chores and still continue to use my AirPods. They don't fall out of your ears and the sound quality is great. If the airpods do die, I usually leave them in the case for a few minutes and I can use them again. If you work in the office, you can put them on to listen to a podcast and they're pretty discrete."
You will never use regular headphones again - Game changer,laurenb1039,5,2024-02-24,"Apple's AirPods have become an indispensable part of my daily routine. From the moment I first tried them, I was hooked. The seamless connectivity, crystal-clear sound quality, and effortless usability make them a must-have accessory for anyone on the go. Whether I'm listening to music, taking calls, or using Siri, the AirPods deliver a consistently excellent experience. The convenience of the charging case ensures that they're always ready whenever I need them. Plus, the wireless design means no more tangled cords or hassle. If you haven't experienced the magic of AirPods yet, I highly recommend giving them a try ‚Äì they're worth every penny for the convenience and quality they offer."

I have multiple pairs of different AirPods and I like them all.

A must,danyeld4,5,2024-02-23,"The Apple AirPods Pro are a premium pair of wireless earbuds that offer a high-quality audio experience and a range of features. Here are some key points to consider in a review of the Apple AirPods Pro: Sound Quality: The AirPods Pro deliver impressive sound quality, with rich bass, clear mids, and crisp highs. The active noise cancellation feature helps block out external noise, creating an immersive listening experience. Comfort and Fit: The AirPods Pro come with customizable silicone ear tips in three sizes, allowing users to find the perfect fit for their ears. The earbuds are lightweight and comfortable to wear for extended periods of time. Design and Build Quality: The AirPods Pro have a sleek and compact design, with a shorter stem compared to the original AirPods. The build quality is excellent, with a premium feel and a water-resistant design.

Great sound but uncomfortable,tabithah83,3,2024-02-23,"Everyone thinks of Apple when wanting the newest and coolest technology so I was really excited when I ordered these. Sound is great and the battery lasts better than my phone, however they are very uncomfortable in my ears for long periods of time."
,Nancy,5,2024-02-23,These work great. Easy to charge and great sound
Great Sound Quality,rebeccak275,4,2024-02-23,This is my first pair of Apple AirPods 2nd Generation with a lightning charging case! I bought them for a long flight and they did there job!! Long battery life and like that I can wear one while charging the other! My pair has been through it!! I've dropped the air pods and the case multiple times and they work just as well today as they did when I first got them!!! My only negative is that they fall out of my ears. It's most likely a me problem!
Not like my first pair‚Ä¶,,3,2024-02-23,These headphones are OK. My only complaint is that they do not last long. The battery on it is not really that great it dies way too fast. I have offbrand ones that last longer.
"Not worth the money, get the airpod pros",makaileeslifestyle,4,2024-02-23,"The sound is pretty loud, but they die really quickly. They don't say in your ear well and is uncomfortable. Connecting them is easy. But one drop of water can damage them forever"

Great for some,gonephishin,3,2024-02-22,"I have always struggled with comfort when it comes to ear buds. I had heard several others tell me these were the most comfortable ones and that they wouldn't fall out of my ears. Unfortunately, this was not the case. The battery life on these is pretty good. They are small and convenient. Overall, just not for me."

great earbuds,iamjealyne,5,2024-02-21,"i love airpods, they're small and light weight. worth your money however sometimes it doesn't connect right away so that does get annoying.

"The Apple AirPods offer a seamless and convenient listening experience with impressive sound quality, making them a great choice for everyday use.",xolorielxo,5,2024-02-21,"After using the Apple AirPods with their charging case for a while, I've found them incredibly handy. The sound quality is quite impressive; it's clear and balanced, perfectly elevating my music and podcast listening experiences. While they don't rival the audio fidelity of top-tier headphones, for my everyday needs, they hit the mark. Pairing them with my iPhone was effortless, and their ability to switch between my devices without a hitch is fantastic. The charging case is brilliant, ensuring they're always charged up when I need them. Although they might not offer a perfect fit for everyone, in my experience, they've been comfortable for extended periods. In summary, the AirPods stand out for their convenience and commendable sound quality."

Didn't know I needed one until I got one,stephanier738,5,2024-02-20,I'm very happy with my AirPods. They allow me to listen to my music discretely. That sync up perfectly with my iPhone where as off brand ones did not work as well. I also like the design that I can decorate my case myself with different cases and stickers. Recommend to anyone who listens to a lot of stuff on their iPhone.
Great for Every Day Use,katet115,4,2024-02-19,"This is my second pair of AirPods and they're 2 years old 3rd Gen. they're better than 2nd Gen for sure, charging faster and better sound quality. I like when I take one of those 2 out, it stops playing on my phone. They do slip out of my ears easily though but it's a one size fit all product so it is what it is. Connectivity is not strong all the time but still good."

Not that surprised,,3,2024-02-19,This isn't that good and you rather buy it at a actual apple store. The battery life last for a little bit it doesn't last that last. These are really uncomfortable and I don't like it. It was easy to connect and the sound is good I guess.

Their compact design and easy pairing with Apple devices make them perfect for on-the-go use. The sound quality is decent, although audiophiles might crave more depth. Battery life is acceptable for daily use, but it falls short compared to newer models.

Win all around,jojangles05,5,2024-02-17,I love my apple AirPods! I use them mostly for working out. They've been comfortable and sweat resistant. The battery lasts pretty long I usually only charge once a week or less. I love that as soon as I open the case they connect to my phone. I have no complaints about sound quality.
Son is happy,Riya,5,2024-02-17,"It was a gift for my son. He is loving it. Got it during black Friday , great deal for apple product."
,WalmartCustomer,5,2024-02-17,Because I've had this product before
Not for the hype,pandabear01,2,2024-02-17,"I love Apple products, but I do not get the hype with Apple air pods. My dad has a set and I have had the worse time trying to get them to connect to his phone. After multiple attempts, we ended up having to get a replacement because one ear bud would not charge. Also the connection took multiple attempts. For being this expensive, I am expecting better quality. ESP for Apple products that are suppose to be durable and actually last. My dad doesn't use them that often and he did not get them wet or anything. I did clean them. Just randomly decided to not work. Luckily Apple was nice and because it was under warrant we were able to replace AFTER numerous chats with Apple care. They also hurt my ear after long wear and I need ones that do not fall out since I am a long distance runner."
Not for me so I gave them away,gloriaj33,4,2024-02-17,This was a gift from a family member. I really don't care for music that much. So I gave them to a friend. I didn't care for things in my ears. The friend I gave them to enjoys them. I assume they are comfortable.
Sounds amazing,Erilah,5,2024-02-17,"Got them for my mom as a gift, she absolutely loves them!!!"
Expensive but good quality,reviewswithmaddi,4,2024-02-17,I like these because they are little but loud. The noise cancelling feature works great. Sometimes they fall out or get slippery if you're exercising but overall they work well. I'm not sure they're worth the price but I enjoy the product.

Not for me so I gave them away,gloriaj33,4,2024-02-17,This was a gift from a family member. I really don't care for music that much. So I gave them to a friend. I didn't care for things in my ears. The friend I gave them to enjoys them. I assume they are comfortable.
4 pair,Coretta,4,2024-02-17,This is my fourth pair no fault of the product. I've lost three pair and re-brought them because they've always worked good for me even the two pair that I had washed never stopped working üòÉ

Quality and easy to use earpieces,sophien51,4,2024-02-16,"I have 2 of these second generation Airpods. The sound is clear and they are easy to use. Pretty much just need to put them in my ears and they connect to my phone via Bluetooth automatically. Battery life for me has been about a week, but I don't use them every day. I also own a pair of JBL but those cannot compare with these Airpods. Took off one star because I do have some ear discomfort after prolonged use (about 3 hours)."

My everyday earbuds,jessthespacecadet,5,2024-02-16,"These come with me everywhere! I have smaller ears and they fit comfortably where as other earbuds hurt after an hour. They have a very long battery life, ambient noise mode makes me feel safer when I'm out and they connect so easily to my iPhone. If you have Apple Music with spacial sound these are just amazing!"

Don't Buy,Tayler,1,2024-02-16,I received these and they didn't work. No sound was coming out of the speakers. I had to turn the AirPod upside down to hear any sound from the outer speaker.

Good for convenience,ginag169,3,2024-02-16,"These are okay but definitely not the best. Been experiencing one AirPod dying before the other when it reaches around 60% battery life. Also, sometimes only one AirPod manages to connect even though both are in ear. Sound is okay but some noise cancelling would make it better."
Good but can be better,cristalr2,4,2024-02-16,I like the sound quality but with time it started to die really fast. I had to charge them a couple times a day to use them. Also cleaning them is a little tedious but other than they were comfortable on my ears

No,goddesscdg,2,2024-02-15,"The charging case is nice to have because it's easy-to-use and convenient, but as far as the ear pods go, they were only tested on men's ears so when females wear them they don't fit right."
good sound quality,cynthiav122,4,2024-02-15,I've had these airpods since 2019 and they are still going strong üôè the sound quality is really good and they are very comfortable to wear. Very easy to use and although i've had them for almost 4 years the battery still lasts a good time.
Fast charger is the tumw saving and excellent  sound quality . Must buy for everyone .,viviann58,5,2024-02-15,"This wireless charging case is an excellent to the AirPods Pro 2nd generations. The case can charge it up to three times. The built-in smart IC chip is a distinctive feature that protects my device from short circuit, overcurrent, overvoltage and overcharge, ensuring efficiency and safety. Its fast charging feature is a real time saver and fast Bluetooth pairing. This eliminates the inconvenience of manual connections and provides a streamlined, time-saving experience.

I recommend them for most people they are just hard to clean,trevord8,4,2024-02-15,"I love my AirPods, they are super convenient and sometimes you forget that they are even there. Only thing I don't like is that when I'm at work (I'm blue collar) I get metal shavings on the magnets and they are extremely hard to clean off."
Great earphones,Digitalfive,5,2024-02-15,This is my second time purchasing AirPods 2nd generation Pros: ‚Ä¢They sound good ‚Ä¢Connect easily with iPhone because they're made by Apple ‚Ä¢They charge pretty quickly especially if you use a usb-c charger Cons: ‚Ä¢ They don't stay in my ears well like my beats do. So I don't do yard work or go jogging with them.
Good not WOW,emmalouis15,4,2024-02-15,"Good sound quality and battery life for bluetooth headphones. After wearing for a while they do hurt my ears, but that just might be because of my ear shape. Down side is the price and the fact that I do find these break quite easily."

Sound good,quincev,4,2024-02-15,I love these airpods. So comfortable and lightweight you will forget they are in your ear plus the sound is great and I love when Siri reads out notifications and messages. However it's easy to lost some where.
Great,Nini,5,2024-02-15,They charge very fast and they work very well
Hurt me,,3,2024-02-15,The sound was great but my ears became very ache and sore. I got where they were to painful to use. They connected to my phone without an issue and honestly I purchased because my sister loves hers but they are just not for me.
Not water resistant,rachelq10,5,2024-02-15,I love Apple AirPods. They easily connect to other Apple products which I love. I wish they were a little more water resistant and more durable. The battery life of the charging case lasts me about 2 days before needing a charge. I will say that I'm on my 3rd pair from my toddler putting them in his mouth.
Love this  apple  with charging case,patriciam342,5,2024-02-15,"One of the standout features of the Apple AirPods with Charging Case is their effortless connectivity. Thanks to the advanced Apple H1 chip, the AirPods instantly pair with your Apple devices, allowing for a hassle-free listening experience. The chip also enables a stable wireless connection, ensuring uninterrupted audio playback. Additionally, the AirPods boast intuitive controls, allowing users to play, pause, skip tracks, and even activate Siri with a simple tap or voice command they are very comfort and last long with the battery."

The noise cancelling feature is a game-changer, allowing me to fully immerse myself in my music without any distractions. Not to mention, the perfect fit ensures they stay snug in my ears, even during workouts or when I'm on the go. Their durability is impressive; they've survived accidental drops and bumps without a scratch. And let's talk about the sound quality - it's top-notch, delivering crisp highs, rich mids, and deep bass. Overall, AirPods have exceeded my expectations and I highly recommend them to anyone in search of wireless earbuds with superior features."

Not that great if noise cancellation is a priority for you,shoshanak3,3,2024-02-13,"It's ok. I prefer noise cancelling so this wasn't it for me. The battery life is average and it works seamlessly with other Apple products. If you can afford it, go for the AirPods Pro"
Wonderful experience and durability,pickbest22,5,2024-02-13,"The Apple products is a pricier because the quality and experience you get from these products is next level. They're so much better than headsets because they don't get in your way. Especially when you are the gym, you can just focus on your workout while listening to your music or podcasts."

Not so Durable,ariels95,4,2024-02-13,"It's all great until the spring breaks on the cap closure. There is no true way to repair, so a new case purchase again. A little more rigidity in the manufacturing would make it stellar."
Apple AirPods with Charging Case: A 4-Year Durability Test,titiiarce,5,2024-02-13,"After 4 years, my Apple AirPods and charging case are still in perfect condition. They've been durable, maintaining quality despite daily use. Battery life has naturally decreased but remains strong, offering hours of use. The sound quality hasn't faltered, and connectivity issues have been minimal. These AirPods have proven to be a valuable, long-lasting investment."
Awesomeness!,ryans333,5,2024-02-13,I bought a pair for me and my girlfriend during black Friday and got a great deal. I know my girlfriend loves these and uses them while doing dishes and chores around the house. Also great for walks. Love how long they last especially with the charging case.

My honest opinion,val33,4,2024-02-13,"These 2nd generation AirPods are a good place to start. While they don't feature the improved audio quality of the more expensive 3rd-generation AirPods, they're made with the same H1 chip so performance isn't drastically different."

Good headphones,ksenfullygood,4,2024-02-13,"I like the AirPods. They are very convenient and affordable. I don't like how it only tells you when you last used it so if you lose them, you might be going on a treasure hunt. I do love how they have a long battery life before the next charge. They're a little hard to keep clean, despite how well you clean your ears. Other Thant that, I do recommend them."

Comfort and ease,shandab10,4,2024-02-13,I love the comfort of the AirPods. I wear them while doing housework and never worry about them falling out. I do find the right ear goes dead after about 2 hours of listening. But the charge time is super quick.
Love it,tienb4,5,2024-02-13,"Customers like the comfort, ease of use, appearance and sound quality of the headphones.

not worth the money,nicole0354,4,2024-02-12,"so basically the sound is good for the first few months. if u use one side more than the other the sound will be rlly low which is so disappointing. its not a full time product, battery sort of lasted long. it was more comfortable than the other airpods but i bought the one with the cussions and bro it has none of these problems i love them so much."
Best headphones for the price,alex109910,5,2024-02-12,"Despite their small size, the AirPods deliver impressive sound quality. The audio is clear and well-balanced, with a surprising amount of bass for earbuds of this size.

These originals are way better than the pro's because of comfort,coriehoopz,5,2024-02-11,"These are the best earphones I've ever had. They are super comfortable and it doesn't feel like you are wearing anything in your ears at all. They're very durable. The sound quality is amazing and super clear the battery life is really good. I usually just use one at a time While I have the other in the charging case and when that one dies, I just switched them out and put the other one in my ear and the dead one back in the charging case and that's how you keep your AirPods constantly charged and ready for use. The connectivity is pretty good as well. It's easy to connect to your phone doesn't take long at all. It takes seconds to set up. I have these and I have the AirPod pros and these are way better. I prefer the original AirPods because they're a lot more comfortable and he feels like you're not wearing anything but the AirPod pros are a lot more bulky and uncomfortable and you can tell something is in your ear I prefer these over the AirPod pros."

The absolute BEST,RenserDann,5,2024-02-10,"This will be my third pair I've purchased over the course of almost 8 years. They are so worth the money. I regretfully bought the 3rd generation AirPods used them for a week they kept falling out of my ears I figured that why not buy the new generation? But, quickly realized they needed to be returned and replaced by the 2nd generation. I will be sad the day Apple discontinues the 2nd gen. But so worth the buy I've used mine on Android and my iPhone 14 definitely give them a try!"

"Comfortable model, stopped working after 2 and 4 years",katehl2024,4,2024-02-10,"Have been using AirPods 2nd generation for about 3-4 years and the mic didn't work well already, sometime connection was lost/wasn't connect as it supposed to be. The previous AirPods stopped working (i couldn't hear music/calls) after about two years. The same model, the different time of buying. It's comfortable to wear and use. I don't know why I didn't put it in the trash, lol:)"
,niamiah,3,2024-02-10,"my airpods have been glitching, the sound goes out and/or breaks up as if there's a bad connection and sounds like static, especially the left one. Outside of that happening occasionally, they are great."
Pricey,candya24,4,2024-02-10,"Good sound quality, they are not very comfortable for me, my ears are small and they don't come with adapters, battery life it's okay. Had them for 2 years then had to replace them, they were out of warranty which suck"
Good quality,anthonis1,4,2024-02-10,Lasted a few years then had battery problems but the pros are a great upgrade! They are comfortable and loud but the sound does leak so others can sometimes hear
they live up to expectations,elenac304,5,2024-02-10,"I'm happy with the sound quality. Charging lasts quite a long time. I'll also note that I've dropped them more than once, there are scratches, but it didn't affect the work in any way, that is, they turned out to be durable. They are also comfortable to wear and connect very quickly"
AirPods are great for everyday use,kristenm1363,4,2024-02-10,The apple AirPods are great for everyday use. They fit comfortably in my ears and provide great sound quality. I love how the case charges the AirPods while they are in the case. They are convenient and good quality. The only issue I have is sometimes I knock them out of my ear when I adjust my hair or my hand brushed by my ears.
Sound is amazing,tiffanyg7,4,2024-02-09,I really love them. But 1 ear pod does not fit in my ear right. The connection was fast and easy. They are very durable but I bought a case to keep them in. The sound canceling is amazing. And mine last for like almost a week before charging. They are expensive.
They're worth it!,piperm50,4,2024-02-09,"The sound quality on these little things is amazing. Doesn't have a very long battery life only lasts about 5 hours with a fully charged case bit usually that should be enough for the day. Very comfortable, can't even feel them in"

Comfort,elenak119,4,2024-02-09,"Comfortable, high quality sound. The downside is battery life. I am satisfied and recommend. You can quickly set up a connection with your iPhone and it's easy to use."
Great,kandycem1,4,2024-02-09,"I do NOT like ear buds with suction so these are perfect. A lot of people complain that you can hear outside noises with these, but that's the point. I love how I can take an earbud out and it automatically pauses what I am listening to. Being about to seamlessly use these for some many different things is great. I love that it pairs with the ‚Äúfind my‚Äù on my iPhone."
I need a new pair immediately,joannah58,1,2024-02-09,Sound is amazing and loud. Now they can go for a long period of time. They are comfortable unless you have small ears. They connect easily to my Bluetooth. I keep loosing them thou

good quality! came in on time. works good!,reviewer,5,2024-02-09,good sound quality! works very well!
Great sound quality,etaylor212,4,2024-02-09,Battery life was great and connectivity was easy! Great sound quality. These are a little harder on someone with small ears and can be a little hard to get adjusted to fitting correctly.
Works as needed,Felicia,5,2024-02-09,Exactly what I needed. They work great; no issues. If only I can stop losing them!
,Susan,5,2024-02-09,We love our AirPods and have bought more in the past
Could improve device connection,migvhs,4,2024-02-09,Great but sometimes wont automatically connect to device and no longer ask for a call to be answered. Definitely needs to improve device connection.

Love my airpods,tastemytruths,5,2024-02-08,Love my AirPods. I've had mine for about 2 years now and they still work excellent. My battery life is still good although I'm thinking about buying another pair. The sound is great and no one complains about not being able to hear me. I think they can be a tad more comfortable but overall good product z
Uncomfortable for small ears but fine sound,69marrr,4,2024-02-08,"Ok so my experience is, the sound quality is fine! But if you have small ears like me they will HURT! So the comfortability isn't great. The battery life does last long though and it connects easily. I got my eye on the BOSE ones though :)"
Great for music! But some issues with mic,jazminr158,4,2024-02-08,Good as earbuds! Sound is great! Life battery is not the best but you can use it for 1-2 days. The microphone sometimes doesn't work very well. But i think they are really good and comfortable.
Ok,linda,4,2024-02-08,You have to turn your volume up higher to hear music
Air Pods,Lori,5,2024-02-08,I'd like to say these went to a teenager she is very happy with them and is currently using them

Great option for an everyday wireless audio device,aaronb102,4,2024-02-08,"Pros - Great sound quality, convenient size, easy to to access charging case, seamlessly connects to my iPhone and Apple Watch. Cons - Prolonged use causes discomfort and tenderness in the area of the ear touching the AirPod (however the newer version is much more comfortable)."
Love!,Todd,5,2024-02-08,I bought these for my teenage daughter to use on a trip. She loves them! They work really well and are comfortable
,WalmartCustomer,5,2024-02-08,I saved $35.00 on the item I purchased.
Great product overall,katem163,4,2024-02-08,I got these on a deal! I know they're not the latest and greatest but they're a great quality product and they sound awesome. My only complaint is that I sometimes have connectivity issues when trying to pair with my phone. Battery lasts a long time and they feel decent in ear. Mine have also been through the wash by accident once and still work well without issue!

Love them but I love the pros way more,ashleyc1268,4,2024-02-08,My first wireless headphones were AirPods. They charge pretty long and lasted me about four years. It's easy to answer calls and switch between songs when needed.

Good,habanadoll,4,2024-02-07,The quality of sound is pretty good on these. They aren't too uncomfortable but they fall out easily sometimes or my hair gets caught on them. The connection is finicky sometimes which is annoying. Overall I like these and have had them for several years now.

Great til they stopped charging,paramolivia,3,2024-02-07,I got these for my birthday when they first came out! The sounds is good and I really enjoyed how seamlessly they work with other Apple products. They did randomly just stop working/charging one day. I only used them for light activities so I'm not sure why. Other than that when they worked they were great. Upgraded to the max now and prefer them.
Why no delivery,David,1,2024-02-07,I'm sitting at home and get a message that my order will be delivered by 12:01 pm. It's currently 11:57am. One minute later I get a message that they couldn't deliver my package and it's being returned to the store. I have two small dogs that will bark at any sound. Also have two cameras that continuously record. NO ONE ATTEMPTED TO DELIVER ANYTHING.
Good overall,danielleh7101,4,2024-02-07,"Love my airpods and charging case. Battery life is amazing - the case holds a separate charge than the pods themselves which is nice. Sounds quality is great, love having noise cancellation - it's the only way I can get anything done! My only complaint would be how often they fall out of my ears."
Nothing positive to say.,manisoboujie,2,2024-02-07,These are horrible. The AirPods Pro are better because they actually stay in your ear. These you have to make them stay in your ear or put them in where they would stay. I wouldn't recommend spend the extra money to get the pros.
not the best,rowans21,3,2024-02-07,the battery life is really good but after a while of owning them the sound gets worse and is no longer as good as it was when you first buy them. they aren't comfortable they start to make my ears ache after like twenty minutes but they connect to my phone immediately which is a plus.

The best headphones for people who hate headphones,stepha39,5,2024-02-07,The sound quality is very clear and crisp. They are super comfortable when most headphones are not for me. They charge up fast and last for a long time. I can easily switch between devices. They feel like an Apple product in terms of the quality of materials. I love them!
Happy,Holly,5,2024-02-07,The least expensive ones I had found and they are exactly what I was wanting! They function great! No complaints! Delivery was completed perfectly on time too üëçüèª

Not worth full price.,josilynng1,3,2024-02-07,"They worked for about 2 years and just recently, completely stopped working. They worked good but also had a hard time staying in my ear. They were loud."
Very loud.,destinyl150,4,2024-02-07,"It has great sound, stays charged for the whole day, and is very comfortable. It lasts for about a month before the left airpod starts malfunctioning. It connects easily."

Ease of use and reliability,carlyn8,4,2024-02-07,Easy to use and comfortable to wear. I have had mine for years The battery takes a while to charge but lasts fairly long. It's easy to connect them to your phone and gives you the ability to talk in private.

Save your money for something Bose or Sony.,kc777,3,2024-02-07,"The sound quality is OK. The battery life is mid range. The case is durable but if you drop it on the ground and you don't have like a gummy case over the case your headphones are going to fly across the room every time you do it. Also, it really bothers me that if my ear gets sweaty or oily, they fall right out of my ears. I've even tried the AirPod maxes with the little rubber on them to mitigate this but it still happens. I wouldn't buy this product again, save your money for something Bose or Sony."
They work as they should,Alani,4,2024-02-06,"They are not as good as the third generation, which I lost but I got these on sale less than $70 and have had them for a few months now. The audio is great, they fit in my ear very comfortably and people never have a problem hearing me. AirPods are superior than most lower end ear buds and I do think they are worth the investment if you are good at keeping up with them. My only complaint if I had to make one is they don't stay charged as long as the third generation AirPods. Still, they charge very quickly and I can still have lengthy phone conversations, listen to my podcasts and audiobooks for a good while before needing to charge. You should buy a case cover as well."
Big sound for small package,matth73,4,2024-02-06,These AirPods have excellent sound and are a great value for the price. Easy to transport and use in any occasion. The battery life will get you through the day in any circumstance.
Daughter absolutely loves them,kelp,5,2024-02-06,I bought this for my daughter for Christmas as she absolutely loves it. Sound is perfect and the battery life lasts a long time. I love the fact it is very durable because she's a little rough with them sometimes. She's young and learning. Great product
Excellent,Lisa,5,2024-02-06,"Excellent, completely satisfied with the merchandise"
Great quality and connectivity!,melissad648,4,2024-02-06,"Great sound quality! No complaints when listening to anything or when talking on the phone through the AirPods. The set up with iPhone is so easy. I don't mind wearing them for long amounts of time but feel like they could be more comfortable. The battery life also could be improved. But overall, easy to use and great quality."
5 years and still going,sarahn320,4,2024-02-06,"You know? We've had our Apple EarPods for about 5 years now, and I've gotta say, apart from the shape being hard on the ears, they're still in pretty good condition and battery life still lasts a good 3 hours of active use, maybe even 4 hours. Sound quality is good on my end, although it's starting to get hard for others with f the battery is beginning to die while I'm talking on the phone. All in all? It was worth the money we spent on them!"
YES,Drake,5,2024-02-06,"came in brand new with charger, nothing was damaged and everything came in great condition. Airpods work so well ive been using for a couple months now ITS SO BUSS 10/10 RECCOMEND you can never go wrong with airpods especially these so cop asf"

Bought this for a gift on Christmas for someone.,Nadia,5,2024-02-06,I love how I got same day delivery!!!
Love hate relationship,alaa12,3,2024-02-06,I absolutely refused to take these out of the house. One reason being is that I find that they die quickly. So if you were to misplace them they would be difficult to find and they are expensive to replace. I like using them when having to clean the house it is convienent to not have to carry a phone around.
Battery sound,ashleyv371,5,2024-02-06,I was givin these pods as a gift and I absolutely love them!!!! The sound quality is absolutely amazing the sound sometimes feels like it should not be coming from air pods.. the charging case is fabulous as a mom of 3 I sometimes forget to charge them but with that case I don't have to remember to charge them. I can charge the case and be set for 4-6 days. I love them!!!

Great headphones!,juliak393,4,2024-02-06,"Great airpods, but they tend to get filled either wax if your using them everyday. The sound hurley is amazing but make sure you clean them!! The battery life is great and they charge pretty fast. I had no problems with comfortability!"

"Good, but uncomfortable. Not very durable and needs to be charged all the time.",sarahw740,3,2024-02-05,"the sound is good, but it hurts my ears. I have to charge them often because the battery drains fast. I dropped them and the whole headphone broke in half so not super durable."
"Fantastic buy, comfort, sound and true quality!",amandar933,5,2024-02-05,"These AirPods are an excellent buy! They sound amazing, they are by far the most comfortable earbuds I have ever owned! They are reliable in connecting and staying connected to my phone.The battery on the air pods could last a little longer during continued use. The charging case is a game changer!!"
Best sound quality!!,ocgirlie85,5,2024-02-05,"Love the Apple AirPods! The sound quality is amazing! I love how I can use them with my iPhone, iPad, MacBook and Peloton! They have a long battery life and are very light and comfortable to wear when working out or hanging out! Definitely recommend!!"
Easy to use earpods,julied120,4,2024-02-05,"My favorite device to listen to music on as it's lightweight, durable, and fits perfectly in my ear. Since theyre small, it may be hard to lose them but apple has their location!"
Can't Beat the Price Online!,Elsie,5,2024-02-05,Fabulous deal and works with my Moto!
Im not that fascinated about these.,dimndsr4evr81,4,2024-02-05,"What I love about them.... I was surprised that I liked the fit and feel as much as I did. They're not the most comfortable headphones I've ever worn. But, they are much more comfortable than I expected. Not as good as the Bose SoundSport. Good enough, and they really did stay in my ears well, even during exercise. The sound quality is quite good. Again, I'd give the Bose SoundSport the nod. But, these are a very good set of headphones for listening to music. Folks listening to me during phone calls said they could hear me clearly. AirPods convert stereo feed into one headphone if you're only wearing one, another nice feature. They charge quickly. When the battery dies, pop them back in the case and 20 minutes later you're fully charged. 5 minutes in the case will buy you another 30-45 mins. They're super easy to set up. They're great for sharing. Since you can wear one or both, my husband and I actually split them up sometimes to listen to the same thing on one of our phones. It charges with lighting adapter. If you have other Apple products, then you can charge with just one type of cable. Most other headphones I've used charge with micro USB. What I hate about I them..... The battery life is just plain bad. The most I've gotten is a bit less than 3 hours. It's usually 2 or 2.5 hours. I spend quite a bit of time on the phone and that's just not enough. My previous earpiece would last almost 7 hours. Sure, I can charge the AirPods quickly and use just one at a time to keep going. But, that's just not convenient. Which leads me to the concern about switching AirPods. If I keep one in the charging case and switch when the battery gets low, I have to grab my phone and restart what I'm listening to. Occasionally, I need to quit the podcast or music app and restart as the headphones get ‚Äúfrozen‚Äù between switching and won't start playing again. Answering calls is inconsistent. Once I've gotten the AirPod to pair with my phone and initiated a call, they generally stay connected. But, I've had tons of trouble just popping one of them into my ear and answering a call, or switching from headset to AirPod. Maybe I have weird ears, but this is annoying. You can program a single and double-tap function where tapping the AirPod while it's in your ear performs a task (pause, play, etc). Again, maybe I'm just not built for AirPods. But, after a few weeks, I'm no better at this than when I started."
My daughter loves them,Kimberly,5,2024-02-05,"This is her second set as she lost her first ones, and they work great!"
Way better than pros IMO,sydneyf107,4,2024-02-05,"The best AirPods! The Pros fall out of my ears like nobodies business. BUT THESE MAGICAL BEAUTIES‚Ä¶. Yeah they are the best. They have a better shape and just stay put. They sound bomb, charge fast, just great."
Sound is great on these,rachelh683,5,2024-02-05,These airpods come with the charging case so there is not extra fee to buy separately. The sound comes in crystal clear and the airport don't hurt your ears if worn for a long time. The battery last a whole work day and I have even dropped the case a few times and they didn't break.
Great airpod,nttlien,4,2024-02-05,This AirPods is a great and understandable price. Good sound quality and they are noticeable. The battery lasts for a long time. Comfortable to wear. Highly Recommend!

Great headphones but hurt my ears sometimes,sarabeth88,4,2024-02-05,"I give the apple AirPods a 4/5 because they can hurt my ears if I wear them too long. The battery life lasts longer than I would have thought. I have had them for about 3 years so I would say they are really durable. Plus they connect to my phone, iPad, or computer really easily."
It's very convenient to take them with you,nadiian1,4,2024-02-05,"The quality of the headphones is good, the battery life is 2.5 years, if I hadn't accidentally wet them, they would probably last longer. Very comfortable but I like the vacuum headphones, the bluetooth connection is excellent."

Poor quality,Sarah,1,2024-02-05,I have had the air pods for 2 months and they won't stay charged for more than a few hours. The case will charge overnight but with no use it dies within just a few hours. I've always had good experience with Apple iPods but these are not poor quality. Very disappointed.

Easy to use earpods,julied120,4,2024-02-05,"My favorite device to listen to music on as it's lightweight, durable, and fits perfectly in my ear. Since theyre small, it may be hard to lose them but apple has their location!"
"good earbuds, but not the best",rachelm886,3,2024-02-05,"i used these for YEARS. they were great in the beginning/when they came out. over a long time of using them, they definitely lose battery life and it's quite significant. went from 5 continuous hours of use to about an hour. after using the pros, i'll never go back to these. but these were good."
,Melissa,5,2024-02-05,Great price. Worth waiting for a savings.
AirPods,Krissy,5,2024-02-04,My daughter loves these AirPods I got her for Xmas.
Great for virtual work meetings and calls,catnipplanet,4,2024-02-04,I love my airpods and use them instead of a headset for work when on the go or traveling which is super convenient. Only knocked one star since the battery doesn't seem to keep it's charge super long after a year of daily use.
Unrivaled Wireless Audio Experience!,marcellok1,5,2024-02-04,"I recently got my hands on the AirPods, and I can confidently say they live up to the hype. The audio quality is superb, providing a rich and immersive sound experience. Whether I'm jamming to my favorite tunes or taking calls, the clarity and balance are consistently impressive. One of the standout features is the seamless connectivity. The AirPods paired effortlessly with my devices, and the auto-connect function when I open the case is a game-changer. It's the kind of convenience that makes the wireless experience truly enjoyable. The design is minimalistic and sleek, fitting comfortably in my ears without any compromise on style. The touch controls are intuitive, allowing me to manage music playback and calls with just a tap. Plus, the automatic play/pause feature when I take them in or out adds an extra layer of convenience. Battery life has been exceptional, easily lasting me through a full day of use. The charging case is compact and provides quick top-ups on the go, ensuring that I'm never without my favorite music or the ability to take calls. If you're in the market for top-tier wireless earbuds, the AirPods are a solid choice. They deliver on sound quality, connectivity, and design, making them a worthwhile investment for anyone looking to elevate their audio experience."
Best buy ever,sosom7,4,2024-02-04,"sound quality is really good feels like you're in a concert. Battery life also lasts so long without charging. Depending how small your ears are, comfort wont be a problem for you. And connectivity is always easy and simple."
OVER ALL NOT THE BEST,victoriar527,3,2024-02-04,Not very loud wish the sound quality was better battery does not last long very comfortable ive dropped them a couple times so i'll say they are pretty durable and they are very easy to connect to so i can say connectivity is good!
Fruit is spoiled!!,brinkleyphilip,2,2024-02-04,The comfort was not what I was expecting from such we'll recognized brand. The sound quality was not what it was all hyped up to be. The connectivity and functionality was nice however.

AirPods 2nd generation,Terrell,5,2024-02-04,I caught these on sale for only $99. They are so loud and bass are great . Sound quality overall is just amazing. I'm very excited with my purchase. They came in a fresh box with a fresh pair of un used AirPods no damages at all!!
Nice sound quality,Jc9973,5,2024-02-04,I opted for the cheaper pair and glad I did. They sound great and are perfect for working out and riding in airplanes.

Love my AirPods!!!,rubareviews,4,2024-02-04,I love my AirPods and definitely can't go without them. They're great for music and calls. They rarely fall out of my ears. The one thing I'd say is they're very difficult to keep clean.

The only things I'll put in my ears,jensena4,5,2024-02-04,"I'm not a big fan of putting things in my ears, but if I have to, then these are the ones I go with. They charge quickly and the charge holds for a long time. They are convenient- I like how they come in their own charging case, so they're always easy to find and I can rest easy knowing they will have battery when I use them. The sound is clear and the price isn't too steep."

hands free!!!,anzhelikat,5,2024-02-04,"AirPods provide freedom of movement without tangling wires, making them convenient for any activity. The process is quick and easy via Bluetooth, and once paired, they automatically connect to your device when removed from the charging case. While AirPods are designed to work seamlessly with Apple devices, they also function like regular Bluetooth headphones, making them compatible with third-party devices. AirPods are equipped with sensors that detect when they are in your ears, allowing you to automatically pause and resume audio when connected and disconnected for convenience. AirPods offer long battery life, allowing you to use them for hours on a single charge. The charging case provides additional charging, extending overall use time. Plus, it's compact, fits easily in your pocket, and protects your headphones, making the gadget durable. AirPods sound great - clean and balanced. I have the new AirPods Pro, which cancel out background noise for a quality listening experience. They can also control Siri using their voice. I don't know how I used to live without them, it improves the quality of life and all this - without cable!"
Great sale and purchase!,Katrina,5,2024-02-04,These are great AirPods. Connect easily and clear sound
Sound wonderful and convenient to carry!,kalynv2,4,2024-02-03,"I love these Apple AirPods! They sound great and have wonderful noise cancellation, even when nothing is playing on them! They fit neatly in my pocket and I take them everywhere I go. My only caveat is that they can easily get dirty in all the little nooks and crannies on the device, so I would definitely advise a case, but overall my favorite pair of headphones I have ever had!"

Can't do without !,andreap679,4,2024-02-03,I can't do without my AirPods. They automatically connect effortlessly to my iPhone. I can work a whole shift without having to charge them.

Good product,ant21,4,2024-02-03,"Apple products and accessories are at the top of the pyramid !!! From time to time, their products do not reach our specs, but frankly, that has not happened to me. Quality of materials, and premium sound, carefully crafted case and packaging... I wish all their products were less costly however, Apple`s devices are also a jewel that honestly we shove around. The pods are working perfectly and if you are a little audiophile, this is what you need."
great,skylars11,4,2024-02-03,I like the battery life of airpods & love how simple they are to charge. I also love them connect right to my phone. The sound quality is good (but my beats are better) They are mildly comfortable but I wish they didn't fall out so easily

Good pair of headphones,Kyrylo 39101,4,2024-02-02,(This review was collected as part of a promotion.) Quality is good. Value is good. Battery charge could be better. I use it rather frequently so it would be great if battery lasted longer

Quality product,aqsam8,5,2024-02-02,Love the airports since they have launched. The sound quality is amazing but doesn't have that great of a noise cancellation feature. They are comfortable to the ears and connects quite quickly to your phone. The worst thing about is their battery dies very quickly once they are old
Great product!,bongn2,4,2024-02-02,"Great sound quality and handy. It connects easily, just put on ears and it will automatically connect to my device. however the battery does not last long though. Fully charged and used for about 2-3 hours then ran out of battery. Also, when I am on a video calls on facebook messenger or taking a zoom call on the phone it did not work, the microphone did not work as well."

very convenient,themadisonlanae,5,2024-02-02,"i love airpods so much. i'm a college student so they are a necessity for me. the battery lasts so long and doesn't take much time to charge either. they sit comfortable in the ear and are easy to hide. the sound quality is also great, very loud if you need them to be. they are also very durable, i've washed them maybe 3/4 times and they still work perfectly fine!!"
Great wireless earbuds,ugcbydanielle,4,2024-02-01,The sound quality is good for the headphone and they shockingly don't fall out of my ears even when running. I've had very minor and infrequent issues with connectivity that I almost didn't mention it. The only downside is that they will die without a low battery warning. I have them just turn off without warning in the middle of phone calls and meetings. Maybe there's a setting I can turn on to fix this?

Multitasking is so easy when you have AirPods.,maryh369,5,2024-02-01,"I don't leave home with out my AirPods. The one thing I love is my hands are free to shop, clean or doing laundry while I can be on hold with bank or a bill that puts you on hold forever. I can hear perfectly and they are so comfortable at the end of the day when I shower I forget they are in. Yea I get in sometimes with them and the survive so far. When you have a busy day AirPods make your day seem not so busy. Then at the end of the day you were very productive. They are worth every penny."

Last a long time!,brandeity,4,2024-02-01,I love my airpods! I've used them for a few years now and they STILL work. I've tried many other earbuds and they last maybe a few months. I use them everyday for hours and the sound quality is great and they fit perfectly in my small ears.
Love the sound,sharyno,4,2024-02-01,Apple AirPods I love them. I love the sound of the music that comes out. It's very clear. Just one problem they die to fast. But other than that is good for me when I go outside and walk the dogs.
"Good sound, good battery life, has ability to track if lost",angelat245,4,2024-02-01,"Love it. Good sound quality and battery life. Very durable. Good size. I use it every day to listen to my stories on Pocket FM and make calls. Very convenient. I like that it shows you the battery life on each earpiece and that if I misplace it, I can use findmyiphone app to find it. I often misplace so this is a huge plus. The only thing I don't like is that the automatic ear detection doesn't work as well. It doesn't always detect my ear if I turn that option on in the setting. Sometimes I have to take the earpiece in and out a couple of times for it to detect my ears. I ended up turning that function off and now my earpiece works great."
My favorite headphones,nikkiel3,5,2024-02-01,I fell in love with mine the moment I got them. They fit in my ears comfortably without falling out. I have dropped both ear pieces and the case without issue. The sound is amazing you can easily hear both phone calls and music without trouble. They last for hours without needing another charge

The real review,timay1,4,2024-02-01,When you first buy this it's great! The sound is so loud which I need because I love my music loud and it lasts forever I charge it every couple days even though I use it all the time. I even use it when I am working and it connects to anything. The only issue I have with it is that over time if you don't clean the ear buds or even if you do they get wax in them and the sound quality goes down a bit but nothing not usable. They are also very easy to loose so keep an eye on them.
It's a pricy tag but worth it.,lusciousl_,5,2024-02-01,"Let's begin with the fact that you automatically feel bougie when these babies go in your ear. Ôøº The sound quality is amazing. Honestly if I really do want to tune out my husband, I just put on noise canceling press the button twice now please don't think that I just ignore my husband all the time we were just testing if we would be able to hear each other. Pop! I've had them for 2 years now, and they still sounds like day one. The only thing you honestly really have to be careful about is the fact that you can go deaf over a period of time if you listen to your music really loud. ÔøºOther than that it's a well made product it connects within seconds to anything I watch my TV when the baby is sleeping with them. I absolutely love them. Ôøº"
Decent earbuds,clairec213,3,2024-02-01,These got all the hype and I find them okay. They aren't that comfortable in my ear and not sound proofing. I don't reach for my airpods anymore when I need headphones.
Go with the older models!,ximermj,5,2024-02-01,"A lot of people say that AirPods are not worth it because you lose them in which somewhat I do agree, but I always find myself going back to them because of this sleek, unique design and also the sound quality behind the eardrum. The battery life is outstanding I personally think that the older generation models are better and more durable"
Too large for my ear canal.,susieo9,2,2024-01-31,The actual air pods are too large and the material too hard to fit in my ears. They are too large but the charge was quite long and connected quickly.
I can't live without these,valb10,5,2024-01-31,"Apple is my go to for earbuds. I can't say enough about mine. They're compact and discreet. For something so small, they have the sound quality of much larger headphones and the noise cancelling feature is top notch. The charging case is a another plus, because l get the most time out of a single battery charge. They connect quickly, the hard case is another great feature. Apple always goes above and beyond with their products."

So good,avreew2,5,2024-01-31,WOW! Absolutely love these headphones they have great sound quality and a pretty good battery life they're also really comfortable and you can listen to music while in class pretty durable and connect to my phone pretty well without any ends and out. The only thing is that they're very small and you can lose them easily but other than that definitely worth the money 100 10 definitely recommend! Ôøº
Sound great if you can keep them in your ears!,carolynf36,2,2024-01-31,"These buds sound great, connect easily and the battery is long lasting. My problem is that they don't fit my ears and I have lost one out of the last 3 sets I've had. I won't try again. Also I figured out that they won't connect unless you are sitting up."
Not great,dylanw13,3,2024-01-31,AirPods are good but definitely outdated with the new technology. These original AirPods are a lot less comfortable and would often fall out of my ears during use.
Ouch,rachelkaylee,4,2024-01-31,"With all the technology out there, why can't they make these for comfort? These kill my ears. They need something to cushion my poor ears. The sound is absolutely amazing. The price-yikes! At least they last a long time!"

Good product. Not a long life,amberf173,3,2024-01-31,So I bought these for my son. The sound quality and microphone were both great. He is a gamer so they got a lot of use. He never had any issues with the sound or the microphone and the. After 7 months they stopped working .i just think they should have lasted longer .fixing them would cost as much as a new pair

Worth the price ?,somiam4,4,2024-01-31,"These are great overall. Sound works perfectly clear. I do recommend this, but the price is over the budget. I do notice some problems sometimes, where the sound cuts off, and all of a sudden you'll hear beeping sounds"

Air Pods help my hearing problem.,giseleg4,5,2024-01-31,My day starts with my air pods as they give the clearest sound. When you are a little hard of hearing they make it easier to hear and I love my music and books all day but getting phone calls through my air pods are just as great. I usually use one ear and when the battery is out I put the other in for an all day use.

You can find better but if you have them they work.,lesliedawn95,4,2024-01-30,"Battery life is okay, it last a decent amount of time. They aren't that comfortable if left in a long amount of time or if put in a certain position. The sound quality is lacking if only one is in, but when two are in, it's better."
Favorite Apple Product,chloek202,4,2024-01-30,I LOVE my AirPods. They're compact and discreet design allow me to wear them and it not be obvious I have headphones on. I've never had issues with the battery life and they've always connected as I've need them. My issues have only been losing ONE or some times people say they can hear background noise.

I've had two sets of them and like to keep them on hand For whenever I wanna listen to my podcast or music

Sound quality and comfortable !,johnnyj11,4,2024-01-30,"Apple AirPods Pro is another great product from the brilliant minds at Apple. I have a small ear canal so until now, I haven't been able to use any wireless earbuds without them hooking to the back of my ears. Not anymore! My wife picked these up for me and I must say the the fit is great and the sound quality and noise reduction is phenomenal. They also have the ‚ÄúFind My Phone ‚Äú feature. So helpful to me. Decent battery life too. Spatial Audio is also something you have to experience to believe. The only issue I have is the fickle Bluetooth connection with my iPhone 11 Pro. I haven't worked out that issue yet but I am inclined to believe it is an issue with the phone. The earbuds are great though."

Great sound quality,ohcolleen,5,2024-01-30,I love my AirPods. They hold a charge for a long time and the sound quality is great. They fit in my ear perfectly and don't hurt my ears from the shape. I was planning on trying the pro model when mine eventually die but it's been years and they an are still working perfectly.
Great till they were not,velvetn,4,2024-01-29,I love these bc they are compatible with Apple products. There's definitely better ear pods out there but the convince is nice. Once more models started rolling out my old ones would no longer connect. Apple also would not replace them
Pretty great!,aleshab13,4,2024-01-29,"I do like my AirPods. They are great. The sound quality is great. They do the job. At times, they struggle to stay in my ears. Especially if I am doing rigorous exercise. That would be my only con. Other than that, I love them!"
Absolutely love AirPods.,cnayers3,5,2024-01-29,The battery on my AirPods is great! I fully charged them and they stay charged for almost a week & I use them every day at work! The sound is great and they fit fine in my ears unlike other earbuds. I like that when I get a text it will read it to me through the headphone. I would recommend them to anyone!

Literally ruined all other headphones for me,bumble222bee,5,2024-01-29,"I will no longer use anything except for airpods!

Horrible battery life,Brooke,1,2024-01-29,The case does not hold a charge whatsoever. I've only been able to use them one because it dies so fast.

Best present ever,adinab12,5,2024-01-29,"I was gifted these for my birthday 1.5 years ago, and it was one of my favorite gifts of all time and most used gift. I use them nearly every day, and they're so great. My only constructive feedback is that they sometimes deliver a muffled sound to the person on the other end, making it not 100% clear all the time."
Great sound quality and fast charging!,shera2,5,2024-01-29,"I got a pair of Apple Airpods to use during my workouts. I wanted something that was comfortable and would actually stay in my ears at the gym. What started as gym Airpods quickly became my everyday staple. The setup and pairing process was super easy. For such a small device, the sound quality is pretty decent too. They are also great at cancelling other sounds and noises. I really love the fact that they are comfortable and do not require any tips to hold them in place. After a year of using them everday for about 6 hours, they still sound great and have held up well. The best feature though, has to be the portable charging case. It is compact, which makes it so easy to take the Airpods anywhere and it literally charges them in seconds . Overall, I am pretty impressed with the performance, durablity and sound quality of these Airpods and I am very glad I purchased them."
Great AirPods,traceem1,5,2024-01-29,"I've tried many brands of wireless earbuds and have even spent more money than these, but these are by far the best. The sound quality could be better when it comes to bass but I mainly use mine for podcasts anyways. They also fit my ears comfortably, especially because I have different ear piercings that others tend to irritate. I would highly recommend these AirPods."

Okay,faithpena171,4,2024-01-29,These earbuds are great. Obviously it works seamlessly with other apple devices. Plenty of settings for you to make adjustments based on your needs and preferences. Sound is excellent. The fit only works well when the ear tips are dry. They tend to slide in and out when your ears are sweating. For me anyways. Transparency is top of the line. That had been one of my biggest issues besides fit. You would hard pressed to find better wireless earbuds

Great apple product!,anht29,5,2024-01-29,"I use the airpod pro and the most amazing feature is the noise cancellation. They absolutely cancel other noises out when you have them on to the very minimum so that you can enjoy the music or talking on the phone. The battery lasts a while as well, up to more than 10 hours of continuous uses. I don't know if different usage affects the battery durability or not but for me, that's how long it goes. Also, I bought a silicon batman case for it and that's very cute!!"
Great AirPods!!!,Denise25165,5,2024-01-29,(This review was collected as part of a promotion.) These AirPods are quick and easy to charge with a lightening cable.

They're OK,,3,2024-01-29,"didn't know myself, but my husband did so I used his. The sound quality was great somewhat comfortable. Battery did last a long time but!! I do have to say that I don't like they would come off from my ear easily. I would bend over do a workout. It would just come off"

Great high quality AirPods,teleciab,4,2024-01-29,I love my apple air pods. The sound quality is like no other ear phones. You can hear clear as ever with them. There is no muffle sound just clear high quality sound.The battery life is fine for me. I only use one earbud so when the other earbud goes out I'm able to use the other one and place the other one back in the case to charge. The case and the pods are very durable i dropped my case and AirPods many of times and they never broke. I love the fact you can put different cases on them to make them unique. I have small ears so sometimes they tend to fall out that's the only thing that bothers me
Great device,,5,2024-01-29,"Apple AirPods with charging case are often praised for their seamless connectivity, sound quality, and convenience. I appreciate the ease of pairing with Apple devices and the quick charging feature. Some mention the compact design and comfortable fit, making them suitable for various activities.

I can use over 2 hours continuously on a charge. These are my third pair,and for the price, they are well worth the cost."
I love this product,monicap300,5,2024-01-28,These have been a game changer. It makes talking so much easier while you can use both of your hands and notifies every thing that's going on on your phone to your AirPods. Battery life is amazing. Once you charge them they last you up to two days fully charged if you're using it daily.
Excellent airpods,,5,2024-01-28,Apple Airpods are excellent. Their sound quality is phenomenal! They fit very comfortably in my ears and are quite durable with excellent connectivity. The battery life was initially fabulous it's still very good but the quality has changed. A very good product.
Son loves them!,emilyg819,5,2024-01-28,"Bought these for my son because I was so sick of hearing his iPad. They are super durable and even though he charges them every night, the battery life seems to be pretty consistent. He also claims they are super comfy in his ears compared to ear buds I've gotten him in the past. I also got him a cute little case that he was able to hook onto his iPad so he won't lose the case for charging."
Used?,Maddie,1,2024-01-28,"I just had my groceries delivered and this is my first pair of AirPods so please let me know if this is normal: The box looked like it was already opened, the lid was halfway off the box and I thought it must've just rattled loose during delivery. After getting the case and AirPods out, the sticky sealing that keeps the pod case closed, the top of it was already off. Ok, thought nothing of it. Then the AirPods themselves look like they have residue on it already, like ear was build up? Did I buy a used/refurbished pair that wasn't cleaned? Is this normal? Never used these, JUST purchased and opened to find this - refer to photo."
Best purchase and I don't think I'll switch to something different for a while.,sandraj147,4,2024-01-28,The sound quality is great. Battery life lasts most of my day. They get uncomfortable only when having them in many hours. They connect most of the time right away.
Noise canceling works well,valerieg121,3,2024-01-28,Nice and noise activated works well. Can't hear anything when both are in. A little big for the ears but charge last pretty long. Connects to phone well.
Good quality,nevaehn15,4,2024-01-28,"Good quality sounds nice long lasting You can now see *almost* all of your favorite brand's challenges directly in the app, making it easy to earn on-the-go."
A must need for convenient daily life,vytle,4,2024-01-28,"I remember when it first came out, I say I wouldn't need one and here I am, buying my second one as I lost my first one. I wish it had a built in tracker for each earplug though. The battery life is pretty good and the sound is clear if you stay in the right range. The range is actually pretty good too. I have to say I cant live without it now, it is just so much easier than holding a phone by your eyes all the time."
Noise canceling works well,valerieg121,3,2024-01-28,Nice and noise activated works well. Can't hear anything when both are in. A little big for the ears but charge last pretty long. Connects to phone well.
they work well,apriloliveoil,5,2024-01-28,i've had them for about a year and they've been working fine. some people say they stop working after a year but they've always worked just fine for me. i use them every day at school and i actually left my phone somewhere in a walmart and they stayed connected until i was about to leave.
"Overall great headphones, bad battery life",rileyh73,4,2024-01-28,"These headphones are a good option, and the sound quality is very good. Has good comfort, durability and connectivity. The only problem is the battery life. It took an hour to run out completely of battery."
Best Non gelling wireless headphones.,brinpink,4,2024-01-28,I have small ears and don't like the wireless headphones that gel inside your ears. I've purchased 3 sets.. battery life is pretty good and fast charging when using an Apple certified charger. Would love if there was a way to adjust the volume without having to use my phone. And maybe a way of tracking a lost AirPod? (Hence my 3rd set). Love that I can skip songs by double tapping. Recommend if you don't like in ear gel wireless headphones!
Love!,kelsym4,5,2024-01-28,I love the convenience of my AirPods. They come with me everywhere for the times where I need to have more private and convenient (hands free) conversations. I love that the case serves as a charging station - helps extend the time between needing to plug in for a charge.
Convenient,shelleya19,4,2024-01-28,"Overall I like them for convenience, but they don't last me more than a couple years. They're comfortable and the sound is good. It's definitely convenient that it connects well to iPhone"
High quality,nhid2,4,2024-01-28,High quality. Almost block out all noise. Nice color as well. Battery is not the best but i have it for years so cant really complain about battery life. I can always get new one
Best purchase and I don't think I'll switch to something different for a while.,sandraj147,4,2024-01-28,The sound quality is great. Battery life lasts most of my day. They get uncomfortable only when having them in many hours. They connect most of the time right away.
A must need for convenient daily life,vytle,4,2024-01-28,"I remember when it first came out, I say I wouldn't need one and here I am, buying my second one as I lost my first one. I wish it had a built in tracker for each earplug though. The battery life is pretty good and the sound is clear if you stay in the right range. The range is actually pretty good too. I have to say I cant live without it now, it is just so much easier than holding a phone by your eyes all the time."

Son loves them!,emilyg819,5,2024-01-28,"Bought these for my son because I was so sick of hearing his iPad. They are super durable and even though he charges them every night, the battery life seems to be pretty consistent. He also claims they are super comfy in his ears compared to ear buds I've gotten him in the past. I also got him a cute little case that he was able to hook onto his iPad so he won't lose the case for charging."
Not worth the money,kseniashul,2,2024-01-28,"I have some problems with my AirPods where they fall out of my ear at any given moment. It's easy to connect to the phone, good sound quality, and good battery life. Just wish they had more grip on different sizes of ears."

"Affordable, comfortable",kenzied43,5,2024-01-28,"These are honestly so comfortable, there easy to hide and not bulky. I've dropped mine in water, and on concrete and even stepped on them and they have held up for so long I have had mine 3 years now!! The battery stays charged almost for me a whole 2 days and I use them consistently. The sound is really good no one can hear my music, it dosent echo and don't hurt my ears!!

Apple AirPods are worth the money!,jennifercoomerlafert,5,2024-01-27,These latest Apple AirPods are fantastic! The battery life is amazing and one charge lasts a full day. They're comfortable and have remained in great shape. I've had no problems with connecting them to my phone and the sound quality is so much better than the previous AirPods. These are definitely worth the money.

Comfortable to wear and good quality and durability,sophiak84,4,2024-01-27,"I love my air pods so much I use them all the time while cleaning or doing school work. One thing I will say is that sometimes I'll have trouble charging them specifically with the right AirPod, where I plug the case in for a while and also try leaving it unplugged and it just won't charge. This isn't a problem all the time but it is a little bit of an issue for me"
Love these!,maddiew64e0,5,2024-01-27,"I love these headphones! Cord free is obviously the biggest perk. The sound quality is much better than I had anticipated. They also sit very comfortably in your ears, I don't usually feel them at all. I've run a few half marathons with them in and had zero issues with them coming out."

Not for me,jacquelyns29,3,2024-01-27,"In all honesty I am not a fan. Unsure if my ears are too small for them, but they would fall out constantly and actually made my ears sore. I had upgraded moons ago to the pro's. Not for all I guess."

I use this often,krisy1301,4,2024-01-26,"I use this when traveling, using the phone, doing patient visits. I feel like the ear pod can be only used one at a time or they fall out. Also they need to be charged often."
Functinal,andrewb108,5,2024-01-26,One of the most used pieces of technology I have ever used. Ever day for work I would pop these guys in and could listen to them my entire day without loosing battery life. The sound that came from them and the easy connection it had to my phone was very time effect to quickly listen to good music.

Upgraded Airpods,Deepa Negi96764,4,2024-01-26,"(This review was collected as part of a promotion.) I have apple 1st gen airpods and now I bought apple 2nd gen airpods. It is definitely an upgrade from the 1st gen airpods and I liked the charging case too which I got my name written on it. I think they can also improve fit on war, it is little bigger than the 1st gen airpods and sometimes slip."
Great sound,5_ft_with_a_hemi_in_,4,2024-01-25,"They have great sound, stay charged for a long time, easy to transport in pockets. My only complaint is that they didn't stay in my ear when I removed my full face helmet ( motorcycle) one came out and hit the ground luckily didn't break, but still incovinent.."

Great,emileem35,4,2024-01-25,Have the Apple AirPods. The sound quality is great. Battery life lasts all day. They fit comfortably in my ear. Easy to connect to Bluetooth. Don't fall out of your ears either .
Not worth price,osaso1,2,2024-01-25,"Horrible experience, I got this AirPod a while ago and I'm sad it has come to this, the sound quality is now so bad I can't hear people on the phone, battery life is atrocious, like I attached a picture that it was full but it hardly last for 2mins, it was great to carry around but not when it will not be used. Not durable."
Christmas gift,Arwyen,5,2024-01-25,Christmas gift for my son. He absolutely loves them. They were ready super fast
Good to wear while working or listening to audio books,cristinas266,4,2024-01-25,Sounds good I use it for work and while I'm exercising. Connects good to my phone . Very easy to charge in the case so it gives it an extra battery life without a charger . Doesn't really fit my ears that well sometimes they fall out which scares me to wear sometimes especially while running . I like when I take them off the music pauses or the audio book I'm listening to pauses as well .
Works great,Kate,5,2024-01-25,My son loves them! They work great!
Wonderful Apple product!,gina,5,2024-01-25,"Excellent item, great quality!"
AirPods,Kishan,5,2024-01-25,I love these AirPods. They are great for traveling and for business meetings. I never need to hold my phone when I am talking or listening on the phone. It also charges with the same cable as your phone.
Good overall,rachels592,4,2024-01-25,"These are great for soreness headphones in terms of size, quality, and compatibility with your Apple devices. But wish it had better battery life - they barely last through a 1 hour call."
Nothing special but get the job done,brookieb21,4,2024-01-25,"These worked fine enough, however they died rather quickly on me and just stopped working. The sound quality was good. They often fell out of my ears which made for it to be impossible to work out or talk with them"
Comfort,luciar211,4,2024-01-25,"I do like the AirPods, the sound quality is great and also the battery life. However the comfort isn't really great because the pods usually slip out the ears. I feel like the durable at some point and connect fast."
Good battery but hard to keep clean,Nicolas98118,4,2024-01-25,"(This review was collected as part of a promotion.) I love the battery capacity and charging speed, but they keep getting dirty and dust turns black quickly."
Outstanding,haileyn87,5,2024-01-25,"These are the best headsets. The wireless design is incredibly convenient, allowing me to move freely without any tangled cords. The sound quality is outstanding. The airpods deliver crisp, clear and immersive audio that brings music, podcasts, and movies to life. Battery life is spot on and works real well through out the day. These buds recharge quickly from portable charger they come in and it usually lasts me for 3 days before needing to plug into a wall charger. Case is super light weight and compact. Fits comfortably in my pocket, bag, where ever I go, at work or just traveling. One most important thing about them is they don't hurt my ears at all even with continous wearing. I've tried the new pro version but ended up returning them because they were too big and bulky for my ears, they kept falling off. On fourth years and still loving these airpods, they're still functioning as new."

The Apple Airpods with Charging Case,vadac3,3,2024-01-25,The Apple Airpods with Charging Case worked alright when I realized my new Samsung did not have a headphone jack. They synced and I received sound. They would be comfortable except I need to wear them upside-down in order for the interference static sound to go away and my music to play. Or one upside-down and one right side up. They'll do in a pinch. I hope the newer versions are smoother.

they are okay,mawmaashley,2,2024-01-25,I am not a fan of this version of airpods. I have a hard time hearing the person I am talking to and often times they disconnect. Battery life in this set is not the greatest.
Becomes bad over time l,lizac54,2,2024-01-25,"Idk, I liked them at first, but they gradually became bad quality. After 2 months they started to leak sound and then out of nowhere only one side of the AirPods would produce sound, even if they were fully charged and connected. Very strange."

AirPods (3rd Generation) with Lightning Charging Case,annt555,5,2024-01-25,"I do NOT like ear buds with suction so these are perfect. A lot of people complain that you can hear outside noises with these, but that's the point. I love how I can take an earbud out and it automatically pauses what I am listening to. Being about to seamlessly use these for some many different things is great. I love that it pairs with the ""find my"" on my iPhone."

Worth the price,michaelaf44,5,2024-01-24,I bought my AirPods a few years ago when the pandemic hit and I had to take college classes online. I was able to wear them and walk to grab a notebook that I left in another room while still being able to listen to my class. The quality was the same as if I were playing it on my laptop speakers. I would recommend getting a case since I have lost them in a white blanket before
Don't recommend,leahg101,1,2024-01-24,"I hate air pods. With the slightest movement, they don't stay in my ears so comfort is lacking. Sound quality is good Battery life is fine Durability is fine Connectivity is good"

,Lisa,5,2024-01-24,These are awesome. Works perfectly and my daughter loves them.
You should try it,kaylinn11,3,2024-01-24,"These AirPods are just üíã! The sound quality is to die for and they go super loud so they can definitely tune someone out. You are able to hear that they are loud if you are listening from a 3rd person POV but their still good. They came untouched, no scratches, not dirty and no dents! Definitely recommend! (and they came with 65% battery"
,Latonya,1,2024-01-24,they was okay didn't really work that well seemed kind of low
Definitely worth the hype,khaliwiz,5,2024-01-24,I will buy these forever and ever. And I've owned in the last six years about three sets of them. Don't ask why they're worth it. They're not too expensive as well as they are staple need for the job. I do very comfortable has a wonderful battery life I will say overall that at some point one year ends up getting lower than the other but it's just based off of use And I overuse mine.
Really good,minhpc,5,2024-01-24,"The best connectivity of any headphones available on the market is found in Apple's AirPods Pro (2nd Generation), thanks to their stable and intuitive Bluetooth connection. Positive impressions are enhanced by the simple method of connecting with an iOS iPhone or any other device that is compatible. I am a rare duck in the tech space as I really don't have a preference between Android and iOS. I have traditionally carried an Android phone and used Apple tablets and laptops. I just honestly find Samsung's innovation in hardware more intriguing. That said, I recently bought a new iPhone 15 Pro for a second phone to leave in my house and saw these new Airpods on sale, so I scooped them. The move to USBC convinced me I need to try both. I have used darn near every credible earbud that has come to market in the last four years. Sony, Bose, B&W, Anker, Apple, Beats, Sennheiser, and many others. I have been chasing the perfect set. I think I found them here or, at the very least, found the closest thing there is to perfection."
Great Headphones,Buyer,5,2024-01-24,"Idk wht some of these reviews are talking about.. My air pods came real deal.. packaged, wrapped unopened, never used %26 had a charge. You have to read the description bfor you buy %26 make sure you're getting brand new products if that's what you'd like. I have no complaints."
Broke after a few weeks,Edmonique,2,2024-01-24,Make sure you get insurance. These are extra delicate and may have to be replaced shortly after purchase.
Tiny but mighty‚Ä¶,lizd163,5,2024-01-24,"Had wanted to switch to a reliable and portable Bluetooth EarPod and I am so glad I received these Apple ones as a gift.

God first pairs,eureek,4,2024-01-24,First pair of AirPods and they were honestly better than the other AirPods I got. They were also the most comfortable pair of AirPods I've worn. The battery dies quicker than most recent AirPods but nonetheless good.
Need improvement,Victoria,1,2024-01-24,They are rigid and uncomfortable. My right ear ached from a poor fit and they kept fall out.
owner,Susan,5,2024-01-23,Love my airpods
Noise canceling,andrianas,4,2024-01-23,Had great sound quality and noise canceling features. The only downside it that they tend to fall out after a while making them a little uncomfortable when doing things around the house.

Everyone needs AirPods,jenniferl690,4,2024-01-23,I love my AirPods. I've had them 2 years and have had zero issues. They connect with my iPad and phone easily. The battery could last a little longer but that is expected. I don't have issues with sound and these don't hurt my ears.
these little buds are a no-brainer!,michaelm314,5,2024-01-23,"These are like having a personal concert in your ears! Super convenient with that wireless magic, and they pair up with your devices like a dream. The sound quality? Pretty solid with nice bass and clear treble. Plus, they're pretty sleek and stay put even when you're on the move. The charging case is a lifesaver too. Just pop 'em in, and they're good to go for your next jam session."
Airpods could be better.,kaydencep7,3,2024-01-23,"The sound quality was very good but the right speaker quit and not from blasting volume. The case would die in 20 minutes after being fully charged. They did feel like nothing was in my ear and were very comfortable, they would disconnect while I had music playing."
Favorite Apple headphones,melissat394,4,2024-01-23,"Sound quality is good, but needs more noise canceling. This is the most comfortable headphone for me. I have small ears and it gets painful with others. Connects quick and battery life is usually 2-4 days"
Great,rosannai,4,2024-01-23,"Honestly, I've had these for I wanna say 7 years. They have yet to fail me‚Ä¶. They work wonderful, absolutely you hear very well with them.

It's eeehh,cultgeorge,3,2024-01-23,"These look like the old AirPods 2 , if they are I do. Or recommend them for running or any sport as they will slide off your ear no matter what ear attachment you put on. Battery life if you use it constantly I say 4 hours.

P-E-R-F-E-C-T!,Julian,5,2024-01-22,"‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê As a passionate music lover and a tech enthusiast, I recently decided to indulge in a pair of Apple AirPods, and I am absolutely thrilled with my decision. üé∂üéß These earbuds are not just a gadget but an experience, and here's a detailed review explaining why they deserve a glowing 5-star rating. üåü 1. Unparalleled Sound Quality: üîä The first thing that struck me about the AirPods was the crystal-clear sound quality. The audio is crisp, with perfectly balanced bass and treble. Whether I'm listening to classical, rock, or podcasts, the sound is immersive, making me feel like I'm in a studio. The AirPods truly bring music to life, with every note and word coming through perfectly clear. üéµ 2. Impressive Battery Life: üîã The battery life of these AirPods is outstanding. I can go for hours on a single charge, and the case provides multiple charges without needing to be plugged in. This makes them perfect for long commutes, extensive workout sessions, or just all-day wear without any worry about running out of juice. ‚åö 3. Seamless Connectivity: üîÑ Pairing the AirPods with my devices was a breeze, thanks to Apple's H1 chip. The connection is stable and quick, with an impressive range. I can walk around my house, leaving my phone on the charger, and not lose connection. The automatic pause/resume feature when taking them out or putting them in my ears is also a game-changer. üì± 4. Comfort and Design: üòåüé® Apple's design ethos is evident in the AirPods. They are sleek, stylish, and incredibly comfortable. They fit snugly in my ears, and I've never had an issue with them falling out, even during vigorous activities. The design is discreet and modern, making them a stylish accessory as well. üëå 5. Advanced Features: üåê The AirPods come packed with features that enhance the user experience. The touch controls are intuitive and easy to use, allowing me to control my music and calls effortlessly. The integration with Siri is seamless, adding a level of convenience for tasks like sending messages or checking the weather. ü§ñ 6. Noise Cancellation %26 Transparency Mode: ü§´ The AirPods Pro, in particular, offer exceptional active noise cancellation, which is perfect for drowning out background noise. The transparency mode is equally impressive, allowing me to stay aware of my surroundings when needed without compromising on audio quality. üëÇ 7. Durability and Build Quality: üí™üèºüõ†Ô∏è I have found the AirPods to be quite durable. Despite daily use and the occasional drop, they have sustained no damage. The build quality is excellent, with a design that feels both lightweight and sturdy. üèãÔ∏è‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è In conclusion, Apple's AirPods have set a new standard for wireless earbuds. They offer a combination of superior sound quality, ease of use, innovative features, and sleek design that is hard to match. Whether you're an audiophile, a busy professional, or someone who enjoys the convenience of smart technology, the AirPods are an investment that you won't regret."

I've listened to a variety of music genres, and I've been really happy with the way everything sounds. The AirPods are also very comfortable to wear.

Can't go wrong with Apple AirPods!,stephaniem1358,4,2024-01-22,"The sound quality on these is really solid. This pair has lasted a long time, is durable and easy to connect. My only issue is that there are cheaper versions online."
Good just expensive,oliviah420,4,2024-01-22,"These airpods are basic but the sound is very good.. they are pretty comfortable for the material and very easy to connect. The only downside is for the price you pay, they don't stay in very well. They have a great batterally life"
Not bad,janana15,3,2024-01-21,"These are good, for the price. I've had a few pairs and one thing i've noticed is that the sound quality wares out over time. I always have a problem with the left ear pod not working."

True AirPods,sharon,5,2024-01-21,"Since having Apple phones, we do not want to hear each other play music or watch shows or social media out loud. This keeps everyone from saying turn it down! Love them"
They fall put so easy,kaylahz344,3,2024-01-21,"et me start out by saying I am a big Apple fan and treasure their products. Unfortunately, due to some defects I would not buy these again. The good I found the sound quality far superior to a five year old beats product. The battery life is acceptable and I am a heavy user. The case is a delight as the case serves as a portable charging station. You charge the case which is portable and the ear buds charge from the case. Could be better The charging light is on the inside of the case so you have to open the case to see the light. Apple fixed this problem on the generation three version. Value for money For me the value for money was a good proposition. Part of the reason for that comes from the bad point below. I also didn't see a shattering difference between gen 3 which I also have and these but the gen 3 is way more expensive. I would choose gen three over gen two if they were the same price. The bad I can't keep these in my ear. Because they fall out so easily and you don't know they are out, i know I will lose the product wearing them around. As a result, I don't take these phones out of the house. Since you are likely to be replacing them frequently due to loss, it is logical to choose the lesser expensive option. Conclusion If you are going to buy this product the second generation is a great investment because overall they are a quality product but you will be replacing them frequently."
love,kayaw10,4,2024-01-21,the battery life lasts pretty long when wearing them and there easy to clean and connect. i've even accidentally put them through the washer a few time and they worked perfectly after.
Good but not the best,leihas1,3,2024-01-21,The airpods are just ok. Very trendy but not the best quality wise on the market. People can hear everything in my background. They fall out often as well.
Dud,Mary,1,2024-01-21,I purchased these before Christmas but I didn't open them until new year. One didn't work at all. Very disappointed.
Very disgusted,joyce,1,2024-01-21,Brand new AirPods went out a month after purchase

Great audio,kathyf77,5,2024-01-21,"Apple AirPods are generally praised for their audio quality. They offer clear and balanced sound with good bass.

Keep in mind that individual preferences may vary, so it's a good idea to try them out if possible."

Good price for quality,emersong13,4,2024-01-20,I've had mine for about 3 months and they work very well. They have a good battery life of about 4 to 5 hours per airpod and have many different accessories to make them more comfortable to wear. The only problem is that my right airpod is very quiet compared to my left. They are a good price for what you are getting as my last ones lasted me for almost 2 years.

Their sleek design and effortless pairing with Apple devices make them a convenient choice for users in the Apple ecosystem. The sound quality is clear, and the battery life is decent for daily use. The compact charging case ensures that they are always ready to go. However, their relatively high price might deter budget-conscious buyers. Overall, if you're willing to invest in a premium audio accessory that seamlessly integrates with your Apple devices, the AirPods with Charging are a solid choice"
,Arnulfo,1,2024-01-19,I haven't received any refund for the AirPods!
Happy child,palisbo,5,2024-01-19,Second time buying for my son. Dislikes that he keeps losing it.
Frequent cleaning is essential to avoid buildup of wax on speakers Frequent cleaning is essential to avoid buildup of wax on speakers,merong,4,2024-01-19,"The airpods are very useful and relatively inexpensive. although it is very easy to lose one or both AirPods, I recommend making sure that they are always kept in their case.

Apple products are for people who know less.,latrintb,2,2024-01-19,"These airpods are made with low quality material. And the battery life is really poor. They sound good when listening to music but when making a phone call they sound muffled. And if you are more than a couple feet away, they disconnect."

Easy for beginners and long lasting!,laurenb996,4,2024-01-19,I've had this product for close to 3 years and they still work perfectly.

Not the best sound quality,jacquelinel147,4,2024-01-19,Got these when they were new to the market and I loved them. Over time the sound quality wasn't as good even after cleaning. The battery life was getting shorter
Semi great,jewelljjmp,3,2024-01-19,The older model was great until it wasn't. The charging didn't hold for longer than 30 minutes after a years worth of use. Sound quality is good but second generation is better
Not great quality or longevity,tiffanyp249,3,2024-01-19,"I have gone through 5 pairs of AirPods. They are convenient and transportable, but no matter how clean I try to keep them, one ear will start to get way more quiet than the other and they become unusable. I also have a lot of trouble using the microphone on them to take calls."
Mid Earbuds,marisap41,3,2024-01-19,"I'm a big audiophile, and needed a pair of earbuds for my workouts. I'm used to the in ear Bose earbuds. These were a big adjustment that I couldn't get used to. My biggest problems were how loud I had to play music cause it offered no noise cancelling or seal within the ear. Other issue is that they didn't stay in my ear, couldn't move or jump around much. There are perfectly fine as long as you aren't used to noise cancelling headphones/earbuds."

Great sound,Goreta5668,4,2024-01-18,(This review was collected as part of a promotion.) These pods have great sound and are easy to pair with the phone. They are expensive compared to other air pods.
Easy to use,,4,2024-01-18,"Easy to use, easy to pair. They're not like the non brand ones that take years to pair the BT and disconnect every second. Music stops when you take em off, that's really nice. It's not a perfect score for me because they slip off easily"

Very satisfied,Daisy,5,2024-01-17,I bought two as a Christmas gifts Somehow I didn't see my order went through and ordered two more which I decided to keep as gifts also One was for an android phone and it never would work for it but the ones for iPhones worked perfectly My son was so pleased with how they worked that I gave him the other one so he would have one for work and one for home.

They are hard to clean!!,chloef169,4,2024-01-17,I have had this product for about 3 years now and it is pretty solid i would say. My only complaint is that one AirPod is louder than the other and it can get very annoying. The battery lasts for a long time and there is never a problem connecting them to my phone.

So uncomfortable,sierraw44,1,2024-01-17,"I absolutely hate these ear buds, they are soooo uncomfortable to me, maybe I have small ear canals or something lol I don't know, but within seconds of wearing them, my ears HURT, I don't understand how they are so popular"
Worth your extra penny,kaylam804,4,2024-01-17,"The AirPods are very cool, and although they might be a little on the expensive side, they are really good if you like to like listen to music or movie or any stuff like that"

Bad product,Senal,1,2024-01-16,"The product does not work properly, has a really bad mic which makes taking calls impossible!"
Good for awhile,hippieorwhatever,4,2024-01-16,"The sound quality starts out pretty good. The bass is nice and the volume is decently loud. However, they are pretty uncomfortable at times. They are easy to use, but don't always connect to your ear like they are supposed too. I have to sit up in bed for them to connect."
I love my AirPods,Danny,5,2024-01-16,We bought these as a Christmas gift for a Foster program. I know the person that received them was very very happy.
Decent Wireless Headphones,yulissao6,4,2024-01-16,"I've had my air pods for a hot minute now. I got them when I purchased my iPad for school back in 2021. Airpods are pretty convenient. I love not having to deal with a cord on my headphones. They fit snugly in my ears and are very comfortable. I love using them on my runs or at the gym. However, the sounds quality for these can be improved. They are solid, but not the best. Mine are less than 2.5 years old and are now giving up on me. The battery life doesn't last very long anymore and one airpod dies a lot faster than the other. I wish they lasted longer."

Sold Apple product,Katherine,4,2024-01-16,These are a classic and reliable Apple product. Exactly what you would expect but buying them from Walmart rather than navigating the Apple Store made my experience even better. Quick customer service without the complications of checking in and the wait.
Good Gift,Tae,5,2024-01-16,Got for my son now he thinks he cool so he's happy I'm happier lol good volume only thing is it takes time to get use to without it falling out every minute but great apple product.

They are some stylish great headphones,robbies15,5,2024-01-15,"Apple AirPods are an amazing pair of wireless earbuds. They offer a seamless and effortless listening experience. The sound quality is impressive, with clear and balanced audio. The design is sleek and comfortable, making them easy to wear for extended periods.

The integration with Apple devices is seamless, allowing for easy pairing and control.

Good for first pair of AirPods,ginah37,5,2024-01-15,"This was my first pair of AirPods and I use them daily!! I got them mainly for the gym. They're pretty comfortable to wear and stay in place pretty well. The sound is clear and and volume works well so I really have no complaints. The only downside is you have to charge them pretty frequently, the battery life isn't the best. I'd probably upgrade to the AirPod pros next but these ones do whats needed!"
Best out there,Jackie,5,2024-01-15,You can't beat the sound quality of the original air pods

work well and affordable,rachelg456,4,2024-01-15,I've had these airpods for three years and they still work really good. I recently upgraded to airpod pros and love them even more. But the regular airpods are a very good price and work well
Not worth the money,kennethb38,2,2024-01-15,I've tried them out before getting my AirPod pros l. I'm personally not a fan there's no rubber so it hurt after they were in my ear for more than 25 minutes. I'd recommend going with the pros instead much better sounds quality and the noise canceling is out of this world.
My favorite,samaraa35,4,2024-01-15,"The sound quality of these AirPods are like no other ear pods I've tried. They connect easily to my phone, the battery goes a long way, and just the comfort of putting them in my ears and going about my day makes life so much easier. Love them!"
Great for comfortable listening,ryanb129,4,2024-01-15,"Sound quality is ok for the price. Battery life is excellent, my main issue is that they do not fit the ear super well which leads to looseness and have fallen out before. They are comfortable though and the apple connectivity is phenomenal."
Kinda in the middle,kimberlyg399,3,2024-01-15,"The sound quality is good but slowly because worse after a while. They are really easy to lose if your not careful. Id say it is pretty comfortable while your at the gym, on a walk, or anywhere really. I like how you can take them anywhere since it's travel size."

"Not the best, but certainly not the worst.",darren13aker,4,2024-01-14,"When I first got these AirPods they were amazing, my first wireless earbuds, but over time the audio in the left AirPod has gone out nearly entirely. The right one still works and they both still have a good battery life, but I can't get over the fact that I can't hear left track audio without adjusting the balance and lowering the right AirPod's volume."
Great sound and so convenient,rileyp62,5,2024-01-14,"I have had my AirPods since 2019 or 2020 and they work great, they are starting to show their age but for them to be 4 years old now I think it's reasonable for me to start looking at a new pair. They are comfortable and charge so fast, they last quite a while too before needing to be charged again."
Great,Love,5,2024-01-14,I love these they work amazing when I turn them up all the way I can't hear nothing however when they are up all the way sometimes people can hear it

They fit my ear and not many earbud styles do. Huge plus for me! I'm a new mom of a toddler and taking on the phone; listening to podcasts, music, audiobooks and social media videos is tricky to find the time to do. I quickly pop these in and I can listen to anything while cleaning, working out or even multitasking at work. The case stays charged for several days- a week and the pods themselves can stay charged for up to a week. I love the convenience of charging the pods in the case on the go!"

Great product‚Ä¶ you can never go wrong purchasing any Apple product.,tgiles,4,2024-01-13,Apple quality is unbeatable. The sound quality is loud and clear. Great battery life. Comfort is good but could be better. Connectivity is awesome especially for iPhone users. Design is good at the time of their release.
Bad business,Net,1,2024-01-13,I ordered AirPods 2nd generation but received AirPods 1st generation only realized after I looked up model number because these aren't MagSafe
"A Daily Must: Easy, Convenient and Stylish!",janam95,5,2024-01-13,"I LOVE these Apple AirPods! They're so convenient when I want to quickly switch to listening to something from my phone quietly. They fit my ear and not many earbud styles do. Huge plus for me! I'm a new mom of a toddler and taking on the phone; listening to podcasts, music, audiobooks and social media videos is tricky to find the time to do. I quickly pop these in and I can listen to anything while cleaning, working out or even multitasking at work. The case stays charged for several days- a week and the pods themselves can stay charged for up to a week. I love the convenience of charging the pods in the case on the go!"
Watch up on the battery lifetime,shirleyd40,4,2024-01-13,We are an Apple Fans. So no surprise that we have been carying all the Apple products at home. I love the Pro version than this version after years trying out. The battery of this version did not last very well.
"Essential, but could be more comfortable",kygray13,4,2024-01-13,"I don't go anywhere without my AirPods. I love the connectivity with my iPhone. The call features/Siri are extremely convenient, and they charge quickly, but I wish they were a little bit more comfortable."
Airpod 2nd generation,Rachel,5,2024-01-13,Nice price and quality
"Work well with IPhone 14 , battery life is great, very comfortable for people will smaller ears.",influenstervoxboxrev,5,2024-01-13,The sound quality and comfort of these AirPods are amazing. I am amazed at the battery life they have I can't wear them all day without having to charge them. They stay well connected to my IPhone 14 without having any issues. There design fit comfortably in my small ears.
Not great,Mark,2,2024-01-13,"One of the AirPods loses charge much faster than the other. So they work, but it's just really annoying."

Decent but not really worth the money they cost,chanayc,3,2024-01-12,"Love the sound quality and the connectivity, design is simple. Only thing I'm not in love with is they never stay in my ears and the battery life isn't always right when you look at it."
AirPods!,jflobry,5,2024-01-12,Bought the first generation of these and they are still going strong! The charging case is the best feature. I can go days without charging it and they will hold such a long charge!! The sound is good nothing spectacular but if you want an easy solution for gym days. These are amazing.
Air pods 2nd generation,,5,2024-01-12,They work amazingly and pair really well with my iPhone. I've gotten many different earbuds. But getting the originals from Walmart was the best choice.

Good Earbuds,ambert260,3,2024-01-12,I practically use my airpods ever single day so I figured I should review them. Off the bat the sound quality isn't the best and with age they do get muffled even when clean. The battery is good for lasting a few days with the charging case. I enjoy the fact it can seamlessly pair to multiple apple devices and which immediately. It can also pair to any other bluetooth device. The newest pro's are far better though.
Must,soukainafdail,4,2024-01-12,I have those AirPods i use them every night i cant sleep without them they are so good wireless charge fast and confortable i love the quality is so much better
"Good quality, not noise cancelling",kristal37,4,2024-01-12,"I like these headphones for the sound quality, but there is a lot of environment sound that comes through. Comfortable in my ear and easy to design. They also last about six hours which is nice."

Inconsistent,jenniferc1480,4,2024-01-12,Goes off and on in one ESE. Second pair that has done this. I love apple products but I have a lot of issues with a lot of their products. Just gets old.
Got to have it,kathyyennhi,4,2024-01-12,I love my airpod one charge last me for 2-3 days. Doesn't hurt my ear even if i wear it all day. Small enough for me to just put in my pocket. Got to have it on the go.
Cyber Monday Jackpot,Dot,5,2024-01-12,They work perfectly. I got SUPER lucky when I was able to buy them for $60 on cyber Monday. I got them for my mother for Christmas and she loves them. She uses them all the time.

Disgusting AirPods and used,Rosa,1,2024-01-10,The AirPods were used and dirty they were disgusting with earwax. Walmart is turning into a store with a very bad reputation. I was so embarrassed because they were a Christmas gift and then the person sent me photos of the crap they had received. Walmart should have refunded my money

Good Product-Sleek Apple Pods,jessicap92,4,2024-01-10,"The sound quality is decent. The battery life is spotty though, sometimes one catches the charge and the other doesn't. Connects easy to Bluetooth speakers. The design is sleek and the pods are comfortable."

Shockingly Great,EJ,5,2024-01-09,I ordered this by delivery and was given a next day delivery date. I was like no way this coming tomorrow. But surprisingly it was delivered the next day. Sometimes the inventory in store is not correct but the delivery next day was perfect. And I enjoy my AirPods. So I will be ordering from Walmart again.
,Areila,5,2024-01-09,It works very well and its realüòçonly bad thing is that if u turn up the volume other people can hear your musicüòï
Answer your phone with one touch,jimv5,4,2024-01-09,I work outside and I need to hear what's going on around me. These EarPods let me listen to music or podcasts and still be aware of my surroundings.

Only good for a about a year,gabriell41,2,2024-01-09,"These are awesome‚Ä¶ until the batteries die a year later and they can't be replaced. They are comfortable & the sound is good, the battery life for daily use (if bothered the headphones and the case) is pretty good for the size, and they connect very easily. The best part is the ability to use one alone or both together with full functionality, and the cool tap options to play/pause/etc. I really liked these but unfortunately the batteries stop fully charging about a year later and they can't be replaced so that basically means I have to get new ones every year, which isn't going to happen."
Great,Marian,5,2024-01-09,My family loved their airpods

Love them,reginiques1,4,2024-01-09,I've been using AirPods since they came out and I refuse to try any other ear buds. These little jokers are the best. The sound quality is amazing. The design is perfect and so is the battery life.
Daughter loves them,Cindy,5,2024-01-09,"My daughter asked for this version and loves them. She says they are comfortable in her ears (as many others were not). Surprisingly they stay in securely-not using for high impact sports, etc. They connect quickly and easily. The sound is great too! She uses mostly for phone calls and they stay charged for a long time. I did send separate protective case and charger and everything works perfectly together. Definitely recommend!"

my first airpods,Teresa,5,2024-01-08,"got these when they had a deal, meant to buy as a replacement for my cousin but she wanted to get a replacement for a single airpod instead (even though a new discounted set was cheaper) so i kept these for myself instead of returning them. sound quality is great, very portable, only picky part is not being able to pause effectively every time when i want to be handsfree but it's fine"
Best earbud for Apple devices,jennac163,5,2024-01-08,"I don't want to love the apple airpods but after trying other brands like Beats, Bose and Sony they are definitely the best use with other Apple devices. The comfort is not the best but they stay in my ears better than Beats did. The connectivity is hands down the best function."
Ok,dallas_faraday,3,2024-01-08,"It works great. The sound quality is fair as they get older the battery life only last up to an hour. For me they're comfortable in my ear. However, if I try to sound the alarm when they're lost, it doesn't play because the case opening has to be lifted up. So that's really redundant And I can't find them if one is laid out. Which is why I have one earpiece only now."

Decent,isabellah156,5,2024-01-07,For casual listening these work great. They have decent sound quality and work if you just need some headphones that will easily pair with your apple phone.

The sound in one went out (bought in 2018, just broke in 2023) but I still use them. Will be buying the new generation again! Battery lasts hours. Never had an issue.

"Great sound, not a good fit",lvlyshorty,3,2024-01-06,I received the headphones as a gift and was excited to try them. Unfortunately they constantly fall off my ears so I don't wear them often. The sound is great quality but I only use them at home because I'm afraid to lose them
,WalmartCustomer,1,2024-01-06,I didn't get them so how am I supposed to rate them
Love them,Lees,5,2024-01-06,I love my AirPods. I like these better than the new ones because they don't fall out of my ears. The newer model AirPods fell out of my ears every time I moved.
Don't buy,ndia,1,2024-01-06,I just bought these and not even a month and the left one is out like how ??

Bad,kassie,1,2024-01-06,I've used 20 dollar headphones that are better. Vattery is bad. They lose connection. They have lots of sound leak. I bought them to use an Apple specific feature which might be worth it for me. Would never buy them otherwise.
New EarPods.,Harrould,5,2024-01-05,They are so beautiful. Holds charge and sounds great. Fits my ears very well. I can take and receive calls. Fits in my pocket.

Good but not great.,gelened,3,2024-01-05,Sound quality was good. The only issue I had was the fit. The battery life was not ideal. The design was nice but not great. I had problems with connectivity sometimes but not often.

,ansley,4,2024-01-05,They work great. The only issue that I have is that they die really fast
Falls out of ears too often,daliaa54,3,2024-01-05,They kept on falling out of my ears. Ôøº I'm not a fan of these. Ôøº Wishing they would go back to original headphones. Ôøº They do last a long time without charging though
Apple iPods,Wendy,1,2024-01-05,I bought a set of Apple iPods which didn't charge right. I took them back today for an exchange and the girl told me I could only get a refund and buy another one at regular price or contact Apple. I asked for a manager and wasn't granted. I had to go buy another set at regular price. I've never had this problem with Walmart before and think I was treated unfairly. All I wanted to do was exchange and on my new receipt it says I can do that until the end of the month. Is this your new store policy?

A-M-A-Z-I-N-G,Zynnique,5,2024-01-03,"These AirPods are just üíã! The sound quality is to die for and they go super loud so they can definitely tune someone out. You are able to hear that they are loud if you are listening from a 3rd person POV but their still good. They came untouched, no scratches, not dirty and no dents! Definitely recommend! (and they came with 65% battery)"

Alright product,Nikki,3,2024-01-03,I disliked that the AirPod would connect to other people and I liked that it is wireless. After a week of buying the AirPod the left ear gave up but I was able to fix it by hard resetting the device.

I did not like the way the pods fit.,AJ386,2,2024-01-02,The pods do not fit well in your ear. They fall out with any movement.
Not Soundproof,kailync21,4,2024-01-02,"I have used these airpods almost every day for two years. They give me listening freedom especially when my family doesn't like the music I'm listening to. The only reason they are four stars is the fact that they are not completely soundproof. Sometimes I would be listening during class and people would look at me. I had no idea what was happening until somebody told me they could hear my music. I do not trust these enough to use them in a crowded environment, but they are great otherwise."

Reliable & seamless connection,stephaniem1378,4,2024-01-02,I love these AirPods as they connect seamlessly to all of my Apple devices. They aren't the very loudest and they may not fit everyone's ear perfectly but for me they do the job. The battery lasts a few hours as well.

DO NOT BUY AIRPODS FROM WALMART.COM,Thomas,1,2024-01-01,"Bought Airpod Pro 2d gen from Walmart.com, they quit working after 5 mos. Took to Apple Store, found they were not an Apple product. Went to WalMart customer service (what a joke), they admitted they quit doing business with the supplier of my AirPods due to multiple cases of fraud. Still, WalMart won't refund as beyond their 90 day return policy. It was a fraud! How am I supposed to know before they stopped working? Packaging was immaculate, very good deception. So, WalMart sold a fraudulent product, knew they had a fraud problem with supplier, will not stand behind what they sold. Walmart is just as bad as their dishonest supplier."

Apple AirPods,Andrew,5,2024-01-01,Great product. Was delivered on the same day.
DO NOT BUY AIRPODS FROM WALMART.COM,Thomas,1,2024-01-01,"Bought Airpod Pro 2d gen from Walmart.com, they quit working after 5 mos. Took to Apple Store, found they were not an Apple product. Went to WalMart customer service (what a joke), they admitted they quit doing business with the supplier of my AirPods due to multiple cases of fraud. Still, WalMart won't refund as beyond their 90 day return policy. It was a fraud! How am I supposed to know before they stopped working? Packaging was immaculate, very good deception. So, WalMart sold a fraudulent product, knew they had a fraud problem with supplier, will not stand behind what they sold. Walmart is just as bad as their dishonest supplier."

Good Solid Ear Phones,S Sturgeon,4,2023-12-30,"Works well. The auto sync up to my iPhone and IPad is a nice feature. I had no issue syncing up to my laptop to use for Skype/TEAMs meetings. I have had issues in the past with other cordless ear buds not fitting well, not these ones, they fit very well. The only opportunity I found is that the volume isn't overly loud when I want to ‚Äúblast‚Äù some music. It's got a good high end but nothing that would have your ears ringing"

Not worth the money,carlyj58,2,2023-12-29,"The AirPods were much too big for my ears and made they hurt after only half an hour. They are so easy to lose and you have to recharge them constantly. The overall sound quality is good, but the battery life is the real kicker."

Staple headphones to keep in bag.,,5,2023-12-29,Airpods have been a staple in my bag for years. The sound quality is about the same as the wired apple headphones (which i really like). It is also extremely easy to connect to my iphone/ipad/mac. I really like how the headphones automatically switch between devices without manually re-pairing. The battery life last throughout the whole day and needs recharging every night which I don't really mind. I 100% recommend the original airpods over the pros because of the fit.
The problem lies with the online pick up,Online shopper,5,2023-12-29,I love the AirPods that's not the problem

Love the experience,Janice,5,2023-12-29,I was worried that my iPods wouldn't come on time as I purchased them on Dec 22. On Dec 24 I received the notification ready for pickup I was truly happy as it was a gift. This was my first time buying anything on line from Walmart. The entire experience went so seamlessly that I will be purchasing everything on line. It's fast and convenient.
I would not recommend buying this from Walmart,Kara,1,2023-12-29,I bought a pair of these for my son for Christmas during a Black Friday sale. Christmas morning he opened them and the left air pod didn't work. I took them back so I could exchange and they said they do not do exchanges and only returns. So I had to return them and buy a new pair at the higher price they are now and not what I paid the first time. I wouldn't recommend buying electronics or anything on sale that could have to be returned.

Comfortable and great audio for a reasonable price,josephm97,4,2023-12-29,"The Apple AirPods offer a remarkable wireless audio experience, earning a solid 4 out of 5 stars. Their seamless connectivity and impressive sound quality make them a standout choice in the wireless earbud market. The design is sleek and ergonomic, ensuring a comfortable fit for extended use. The effortless pairing with Apple devices via Bluetooth simplifies usage, while the hands-free Siri access adds convenience. However, the lack of noise isolation might be a drawback for some, especially in noisy environments. Additionally, the battery life, though decent, falls slightly short compared to some competitors. Despite these minor limitations, the AirPods excel in delivering clear sound, reliable connectivity, and an overall user-friendly experience. Their integration with the Apple ecosystem and portability make them a compelling option for those seeking reliable wireless earbuds."

worth it but some flaws,ozziep,4,2023-12-28,Over all good product the sound quality is very good as you can expect with apple. the battery life is pretty decent i only had to charge them about every 1-2 days. they aren't very comfortable but that's all you can expect from shoving a piece of hard plastic in your ear. they are overall worth it except for the fact that after a while of using the audio gets quieter and my left one fails to have almost any audio now.

Fall out of ears,madisonl175,4,2023-12-28,I enjoy these airpods a lot but the only thing that is frustrating is occasionally they do fall out of my ears. So sometimes like at the gym it's hard to wear them and bend down to grab something without them falling out.

Seamlessly,longl8,5,2023-12-28,"Just started using the Apple AirPods with the charging case, and I'm impressed. The wireless experience is liberating, and they connect seamlessly to my devices. The case is compact, keeping them charged on the go. While the sound quality is fantastic, the lack of noise cancellation is noticeable. Overall, a solid choice for wireless earbuds, especially if convenience is a priority."
Best wireless earphones,jenniferk543,4,2023-12-27,"These earphones are stylish and comfortable. They're wireless and super easy to connect to your iPhone. I can go days without having to charge them too which is awesome. Reason why is because you charge the case which charges the pods. If the pods battery are running low it, it's not long before they're charged if you place them in the case. Overall great product. 4 stars because I wish they had a button where you could locate a list pod through your apple devices."

Consequently, I am inclined to suspect that the current AirPods may be replicas."

Best wireless earphones,jenniferk543,4,2023-12-27,"These earphones are stylish and comfortable. They're wireless and super easy to connect to your iPhone. I can go days without having to charge them too which is awesome. Reason why is because you charge the case which charges the pods. If the pods battery are running low it, it's not long before they're charged if you place them in the case. Overall great product. 4 stars because I wish they had a button where you could locate a list pod through your apple devices."
There fake,nikki,2,2023-12-27,"the light in the middle of the case is not there light weight one ear at a time works ,they don't work together."

AirPod holds a long charge,Linda,5,2023-12-27,This is my second set of AirPods. My last pair slipped out of my pant pocket. Works very well and keeps a long charge. This time I bought the rubber holder and put a keyring clip so I wouldn't lose it. I lock it onto my belt loop when using it.

Great airpod,fergusn,5,2023-12-26,"These 2nd gen AirPods worked really well for me. They have a sleek design that beats other wireless earbud brands hands down. Comfort-wise, they're a winner - they stay snug even after hours of use. They fit perfectly and don't cause any discomfort, even during long wear. They connect flawlessly with my iPhone. Sometimes only one connects, but a quick reset in the case fixes it. Impressive audio output for an earbud. Battery Life: Great, can use them all day without having to charge"
Put ‚Äòem on your keys to listen to your music and podcasts anywhere,sailorvallerina,4,2023-12-26,I do love the original AirPods though I also own the first generation Pros as well. The AirPods fit better in my ears than the Pro even without the rubber tip. Sound quality is still good though lacking the obvious noise cancellation feature. They live on my keychain and the battery lasts a *very* long time.

Good sound quality,Jaclyn,4,2023-12-24,"The Apple AirPods offer seamless connectivity, good sound quality, and convenient features like automatic pairing. The wireless design and compact charging case enhance portability. However, the fit is less secure than other headphones, and the price is relatively high compared to other wireless earbuds with similar features."
,WalmartCustomer,5,2023-12-24,"The package was in mint condition upon pickup, nothing was damaged whatsoever."

Airpods are the best ever but‚Ä¶,marivicks,4,2023-12-24,"Airpods are without a doubt the best headphones I ever used. They sound good, they're loud and they are comfortable. They last a long time and connect quickly so you don't have to worry about that. And the design is good. One complaint I have is the fact that they don't last long in terms of quality. After a while my left airpod died every 5 minutes or less despite being fully charged. These are older though."

Nice and comfort,vyn67,4,2023-12-24,"The Apple AirPods charging case is a sleek and compact accessory that complements the wireless earbuds seamlessly. Its build quality is impressive, offering a premium feel. The convenience of wireless charging enhances user experience, and the LED indicator provides clear battery status. However, the glossy surface tends to attract fingerprints easily. Overall, it's a well-designed case that aligns with Apple's commitment to style and functionality."

Batteries and sound,hongp3,5,2023-12-24,I wish I would purchase this airpod earlier . It is so convenient for me when I have meeting while I am at work or driving.

The batteries last me 1 weeks without charging. Thanks Airpod saves my time and allow me to do multitasks

Amazing simply amazing,millik1,5,2023-12-24,"The Apple AirPods offer a seamless wireless experience with quick pairing, excellent sound quality, and convenient touch controls. The compact charging case enhances portability, and the integration with Siri adds a touch of smart functionality. However, the design might not fit everyone comfortably, and the price is relatively high compared to other wireless earbuds on the market. Overall, if you're deeply entrenched in the Apple ecosystem and prioritize ease of use, the AirPods are a solid choice."

Not nearly as good as the Samsung buds but the only useable option if you have an iPhone,mattb76,5,2023-12-23,"Not terrible, and they're really easy to use. Decent sound quality but I hate how they feel. They constantly feel like they're on the verge of falling out. Overall I really just miss my Samsung Buds.

Walmart charged me twice,CSmith2001,4,2023-12-23,"the ipods are fine , Walmart however has left a pending hold on my account for ten days - so that I cannot spend 108.00 charged until they decide to release it.

I would buy the AirPod Max instead,evaz5,3,2023-12-21,"Honestly, I do not really love the Apple AirPods. I find that they do not produce a loud sound and often fall out of my ears. Even though it is pricier, I would suggest the Apple AirPod Max if you are looking for a headphone."
Both our kids are really happy with them,karlam493,5,2023-12-21,"Husband and I bought our kids AirPods. My daughter who is 17 years old says they are easy to connect to any device, have clear & loud sound. They are lightweight and comfortable to wear during workouts and don't fall out when running. They are very good quality for the price."

Horrible,jennifern350,2,2023-12-20,I say get the AirPods Pro because you can track those. If you lose these then you can't do anything. You have to be connected to actually be able to track your AirPods it's not worth it!

The perfect gift,ashleys1776,4,2023-12-20,Got the apple airpods as a Christmas gift. Great quality and the sound was amazing. These things stayed charged forever and if I did need to charge them they charged really fast. The only thing I didn't like is I felt like they didn't fit my ears good and because of that they felt a little heavy.
,christina,1,2023-12-20,I didn't care for the sound. It wasn't very loud and not much of a bass.
Super convenient headphones!,shaybayna,4,2023-12-20,"I've had this for about 2 1/2 years now and it's still works good but after a while, the battery life will slowly diminish but the charging is fast I could put it in the case for ten minutes and it'll be charged well. The sound comes out well but when you're using find my AirPod, you have to be super quiet to hear it. I like these headphones, it's super convenient .Ôøº"

Good for teens,flyguy,5,2023-12-20,Apple has been a leader when it comes to the design of the air pods and overall you know what you're getting when it comes to this product. Great sound quality.

,Estabonique,3,2023-12-20,Love the features. But they don't hold a charge as long as I thought.
airpods suck,calibaby2o9,2,2023-12-20,"There is a few things I dislike about the airpods I purchased. I hardly had time to use them till I got one week off from work. Those things I dislike is that the left airpod won't work if the right airpod ain't on. Or if you have both on, and remove the right one music will completely stop. Even if you have the left one in, it still won't work."
Great deal!,Ingrid,5,2023-12-20,I love them! Second time purchasing them and it was a great Black Friday deal

AirPods,mattb35,4,2023-12-20,"Having recently purchased the Apple AirPods with the wireless charging case, I'm impressed with the seamless connectivity, stellar audio quality, and the added convenience of wireless charging. The sleek design and effortless setup make them a standout choice, especially for those deeply ingrained in the Apple ecosystem. Despite the premium price tag, the overall performance and enjoyable listening experience make these AirPods a worthwhile investment."

I received a txt msg with a picture from the individual who received my package and it included my Name, Order %23, and picture of the product i purchased. All Walmart Reps refused to believe the package had been delivered to the wrong person and claimed the parcel had not been delivered yet, then claimed it was returned to the store and then 12/10 claimed it had been delivered! Total incompetence is my summary of Walmarts resolution to this issue."

"Hard in the ear, slips out during workouts",Stephanie,3,2023-12-11,"I like these because they're easy use, to pair, the sound is decent, and the mic works fine. But, my last pair of earbuds were Beats Studio Buds and I much prefer the fit and sound of those to the AirPods. It may be due to a better fit in the ear but the Studio Buds sound a little better and are easier to use in terms of starting, stopping, or pausing music, etc."
Not satisfied,Shy,1,2023-12-11,Not a good quality sound and they won't stay in my ears.

Suitable for all ages,,4,2023-12-11,"This is my fourth one, beautiful design, suitable for all ages, very convenient, I don't need to hold the phone to listen to music and talk. Because it often falls out, I bought a new one, it's very durable!"

Disappointed in play length.,thomas,3,2023-12-11,"They sound good and sync-up fast in Bluetooth but the batteries don't last more than about 4 hours before they cut out. According to their specs, they should last twice that time."
"Comfortable, reliable ear buds",,4,2023-12-11,"The sound quality is crystal clear and battery lasts me about a day on these when NOT in frequent use so I do wish they lasted me longer before needing a charge, but they have a reliable connection.

Great,roba17,4,2023-12-10,Connection is good. Battery is good but can be better. It is good for the price though. I don't regret my buy. It was well worth it. Thanks Apple !!!
Horrible!,bianca,1,2023-12-10,I got the wrong pair. I meant to get the AirPod 2nd. Pro. But instead was sent the original AirPod the ones that don't come with earpieces. They hurt the inside of my ears. I've only used them twice and I don't expect to use them again I want to return them.

Only received one of the two AirPods I bought!,james,1,2023-12-10,Only received one of the two AirPods I bought!
Do not trust their delivery!!,sarahj316,1,2023-12-10,Worst experience with online ordering! Same day delivery is a joke. First it was delayed which wasn't a huge problem. When their delivery driver delivered it to an adjacent street instead of my home is when the nightmare began. I don't know exactly where they dropped it off but it was not my house. The picture the driver took shows the correct house number‚Ä¶..but it's not my house. The site allows you to see the driver as they approach‚Ä¶ they never entered my street. It's delivered to a random person now!!! Merry Christmas whoever you are‚Ä¶.. immediately I hit the need help link on the order page. They said to wait 48 hrs before they can send another pair. At this point I do not trust their delivery and simply want my money back. Dealing with their care team resulted in 45 mins of wasted time. When I asked for a supervisor they referred me to 1800walmart. Again I'm told I need to wait 48 hrs. I am deeply disappointed with their lack of concern for customers delivery's. I am a single mother and those AirPods are the main gift I'm giving my teenager. Having the funds for this gift being tied up for 48 hrs is super stressful. If you want my opinion just pick it up at the store yourselves. It's not worth the aggravation and worry if you're going to get your items. Then god forbid you don't get them‚Ä¶.the hassle of waiting such a long time to be refunded isn't worth it. Walmart do better! I'd give 0 stars if I could.

Not good,Sheri,2,2023-12-10,You canceled a order because you were out of stock and I still haven't gotten my refund. You sure took my money right away why do I have to wait for it back and it's been longer then you said

Good,,4,2023-12-09,Sound quality and battery life are good. Comfort not so much. It starts to hurt my ears after 30 minutes of usage. Other than that it's a good product.
,WalmartCustomer,4,2023-12-09,Walmart had the cheapest price at the moment
,Tyler,3,2023-12-09,Earbuds don't really stay in the ear great so there always falling out. They are definitely good to have but they'd be better if they stayed in
,WalmartCustomer,1,2023-12-09,I can't rate this because I am not even sure if my item is going to be delivered on time. This whole experience has been a disaster so far.
Decent but lacks longevity,graceb384,3,2023-12-09,Sound quality was good and overall the AirPods were great but they eventually started getting worse battery life very quickly. Very comfortable

Awesome and great ear buds.,gregoruya,4,2023-12-09,This AirPods are very good. Connect and pair to your iPhone quickly. Are comfortable when put into my ears. The sound quality works well. Was able to wear them for the whole day and its battery case charged the AirPods fast and the AirPods lasted very long after charging.
,hi,4,2023-12-09,"The AirPods 2nd Gen by Apple have undoubtedly set the standard for wireless earbuds, and their exceptional performance across various categories earns them a well-deserved five-star rating. First and foremost, the convenience factor of the AirPods is unparalleled. The seamless pairing with Apple devices through the H1 chip ensures a hassle-free connection every time you open the case. The instant connectivity, coupled with the automatic play/pause feature when removing them from your ears, enhances the overall user experience. Sound quality is a standout feature of the AirPods 2nd Gen. The audio reproduction is crisp, with well-balanced bass and clear mids and highs. Whether you're listening to your favorite music, taking calls, or watching videos, the AirPods deliver an immersive sound experience that belies their compact size. The battery life is impressive, offering several hours of playback on a single charge. The convenience of the charging case provides additional on-the-go usage, and the quick charge feature ensures that a short charge delivers a substantial boost in battery life. This makes the AirPods an ideal companion for long commutes, workouts, or travel. The design of the AirPods remains iconic, with a sleek and minimalist aesthetic that is instantly recognizable. The earbuds fit comfortably in the ears, and their lightweight nature makes them suitable for extended use without causing discomfort. The inclusion of touch controls on the earbuds adds to the overall convenience. With a simple tap, users can play or pause music, answer calls, and activate Siri, streamlining the interaction process. One of the few areas where the AirPods 2nd Gen could see improvement is in their noise isolation capabilities. While they offer decent passive noise cancellation, they might not be the best choice for those seeking complete isolation in noisy environments. In conclusion, the AirPods 2nd Gen represent the epitome of wireless earbud technology. With a perfect balance of convenience, sound quality, and sleek design, they cater to the needs of both Apple enthusiasts and casual users alike. If you're in search of earbuds that seamlessly integrate into your Apple ecosystem while delivering a superb audio experience, the AirPods 2nd Gen are an absolute must-have, earning them a solid five-star rating."
Superior sound,Gosund,4,2023-12-09,I like them. I like how they sound and how they connect and integrate with Apple devices. I have had the pro version which fits better and stays better in the ear. Pros are superior. But the AirPods are better than any other non Apple on the market.
,WalmartCustomer,5,2023-12-09,"This order was a Christmas gift for my grandson, I assume they will be in good working order when opened and used."
Great but not for exercising,Sandy,4,2023-12-09,Like the product but the only complaint I have is that they will not stay in my ears when I'm exercising no matter what I do otherwise they are great.
Great AirPods,Miller88,5,2023-12-08,I've never saw the hype of AirPods before I got a par. Works great with iPhone and even the find my app.

,WalmartCustomer,5,2023-12-08,It is a gift so I haven't used the it yet. I was satisfied with the price and based on reviews I'm sure I will be satisfied with the item.
very poor delivery service!,Kathy,2,2023-12-08,This is the second time that my order was delivered to the wrong address. Thank goodness I remembered where it was delivered the last time so I just went to that address and there was my order. I'm not sure who you hire to do your driving but if they can't find my address they have a real problem! And that's a problem you need to take care of. I will definitely think twice before I order from Walmart again!.
"Quality Sound, Convenience, and Price",Grammy,5,2023-12-08,"The Apple AirPods are a true game-changer in the world of wireless earbuds. They have the typical Apple sleek design with seamless connectivity which we have come to expect with their product. Apple continually sets a high standard in the tech market. Design- they are compact and easy to transport. The AirPods present a minimalistic, clean, and sleek design that come in a handy charging case. Audio Quality: the sound quality is impressive for earbuds of this size. The audio is crisp and clear. Remarkably impressive for this price point. They seamlessly connect with any Apple device. The pairing process is seamless, and the automatic connection across any Apple product is one of its standout features. The integration with Siri for voice commands is also a plus. The battery life is typical with it being around 5 hours of listening time per charge. A really nice feature is the quick charge. This provides around 3 hours of use with just 15 minutes of charging. Touch controls allow for easy access to various functions like play, pause, skipping tracks, and activating Siri. Apple did not disappoint yet again with these AirPods. Buy them. You will not regret it!"

They're ok,Derena,3,2023-12-08,"Haven't had 2 months and didn't but protection plan. Shouldn't HAVE to buy one for them to just work for a long period of time. Anyways, 1 side isnt as loud and clear and should come with silicone covers to keep sturdy in ear which can assist with them falling out, damage or losing and have to purchase a whole new set. Anyways, they're ok"
Love the cost,Tanesha,3,2023-12-08,They don't stay charged long enough when I use them I would say l couldn't get a hour before I have to use a different ear and sometimes they aren't working right with the phone might have to cut the phone off and back on

Not received,Zoey,1,2023-12-06,I can't really leave a good review because I never received them. Walmart said they delivered them to my back door but there's no picture proof and I never received them and of course they won't do anything to help return them.

Love Them!,Les,5,2023-12-06,They work really well and don't slip out of the ears as easily as the newer smaller ones. The sound quality is really good too and they can get very loud. So far I haven't experienced the thing where if you turn it up somewhat loud other people can hear it.

Love these AirPods.,Nette1,5,2023-12-06,I purchased these AirPods before they lasted for 4 years I gave my old pair to my sister because the right AirPods didn't hold a long charge the the left AirPods still is good just brought a new pair because the pro was so good on Black Friday I couldn't pass it up compared to what I paid for the first pair. AirPods are great for being hands free.
Comfortable,mileenak,4,2023-12-06,I personally like this because they read out your notifications for you so you don't have to check your phone every 2 seconds. They feel comfortable and nice sitting in your ears. Battery life tends to last me about 8-10 hours or sometimes 12 hours when I actively listen to music

Oldie but a goodie,Maia,5,2023-12-04,This is like my fourth pair of AirPods. But these were a gift. Always easy to set up. Always convenient to use. Definitely a recommended buy.
One side didn't last charged.,euddy,1,2023-12-04,"Battery didn't last in one side, and kept disconnecting."
Snap  Crackle %26 Pop,CBD,1,2023-12-04,Left pod frequently doesn't register. Constantly have to reinsert Left pod back into case. Frequently both have delayed audio and popping audio. This pair seems to be faulty. Previous pair never had these issues‚Ä¶but i left those behind at a hotel while out of town.

Empty Box,JJ,1,2023-12-03,CAUTION!!!! Received an empty box. Walmart did nothing to remedy the situation. Customer support told me that I had to dispute it with my bank and that they would not price match to the sale price at time of purchase.

"Not a good one, but good info to know!",Nicole,1,2023-12-02,"The delivery guy did not deliver these. I called the store 3 minutes after the delivery guy left my house and was on hold for 1 hour. I ended up driving to the store to talk to them. After almost an hour and WalMart calling the Spark delivery guy, they gave me a new pair. These are for Christmas, so hopefully they work. The pair I now have does not have the same serial number that I purchased for delivery."
Great headphones,breemh17,4,2023-12-02,It took me a very long time to hop on the air pod trend‚Ä¶I just got my first set of AirPods the other week from target. I used to use the old iPhone headphones that came with the iPhones. Not I won't lie o was worried I'd loose one and never be able to find it again. Luckily this has not happened? And my AirPod feel very good.

Battery issue,Pisces88,1,2023-12-02,I don't like the length of battery the earbuds themselves have. Seems like they die fairly fast and they are in the case majority of the time. Until I need them

AirPods Gen 2,Andrea,5,2023-12-02,This are great for my 13 yr old. They actually fit in her ears and are easy for her charge and connect to her phone
Fit nice and don't fall out,charlottew184,4,2023-12-01,I have small ears and these fit nicely without falling out. The sound quality is great as well and it's pretty small where you can just carry it along with you anywhere. The battery life is pretty good as well.
Perfect!,Dyan,5,2023-12-01,"Having always used inexpensive earbuds, I decided to finally invest in actual AirPods. If I had known what I was missing in sound quality I would have never have put it off. It is amazing the richness and depth these little buds provide and that they sync so quickly with all my Apple products, bonus. They are in my ears constantly now, lol. Love them!"

Air pods,Kashmirzp,5,2023-12-01,Work well. Actually not that impressed with them compared to the ones I have from Amazon. They do have a second or two sound delay.
Average quality at best,bryanp26,2,2023-12-01,"Not a huge fan of these. Battery life isn't the best. Sound is okay, but there's several out there that are much better. I will continue to stay away from these even if i have an iPhone."

"Great product, bad delivery",zach,3,2023-11-30,The item speaks for itself. This is the last time I will ever use the delivery portion. Who in their right mind says that it's a good idea to leave a pair of AirPods on someone's doorstep in nothing but a see through bag? I guess Walmart is out of boxes? At least put it in a poly mailer or something that attempts to hide the contents of the bag. These were out in the open for anyone to walk by and help themselves. Do better!!
,WalmartCustomer,3,2023-11-30,i dont have it yet.
,WalmartCustomer,5,2023-11-30,"The seamless connectivity, crystal-clear audio, and impressive battery life have truly enhanced my daily life.

AirPods,Pramod,5,2023-11-30,First time ever I bought this AirPods. Apple is just an apple. Can't be orange or peach. Sound quality is good. Thanks to Walmart for giving this deal.
Good sound quality,nishas56,4,2023-11-29,The sound quality of apple airpods are good. The battery sustain for sufficient time. It easily connect with mobile. It can be easily carry anywhere.
LOVE,sophiap211,4,2023-11-29,I love these and I carry them everywhere and there easy to find on your phone is you loose them. The only problem for me is they don't fit perfectly in my ear sometimes they slip out.
,WalmartCustomer,5,2023-11-29,"Overall the product I received, arrived in good shape, no cracks or dents. And the AirPods itself worked amazing as I was expecting, the sound quality sounds very clear and can go up to a high volume, in addition there are no sound leaks which was also something I was looking for when searching for the best ear buds and AirPods checked all the boxes. Now for the price, it was a good deal since I got to save 35 dollars but then I had to pay almost the same exact price when I added shipping, during the Black Friday Sale, which defeats the purpose of a Black Friday Sale."
Love Them!,,5,2023-11-29,"Come on now there airpods of course I'm enjoying them, can't lie apple makes some of the best products! Only downside I would say is that the case dies a little too fast for my liking, but other than that I'm enjoying them!"
Great,addief6,4,2023-11-29,These are great headphones because they are small. The battery life is long and they have a great sound. Only downside is occasionally they might fall out while moving around a lot but overall love them.

NOT REAL,Lmomma,1,2023-11-28,I bought these and the sound wasn't right in one of them and when I contacted Apple they couldn't find it with the serial number. These aren't legit. Don't waste your money. Not sure why Walmart is selling these‚Ä¶

Apple AirPods 2nd gen review,GP,3,2023-11-28,"Liked the AirPods, but not happy that they keep slipping from the ears. Apple cannot make these kind of products which slip from the ears although they are not Pro. 3rd party audio pods fit better in the ears than these AirPods and are much cheaper. Happy with Wal-Mart for the order process. But, not happy with Apple for making a product which can't stay in the ears after spending so much money."

Good but sometimes issue with the wireless charging,iliobsessed1,4,2023-11-28,Honestly I've always used apple products. For some reason the AirPods stay giving me problems. I'm on my third pair and they disconnect from my Bluetooth and sometimes the wireless charging doesn't really charge.

Good Ear pro,ashleyc852,4,2023-11-27,"The sound quality for the air pods are good but do have issues with them at time with the sound going out. It might be because I had the AirPods for a while but would still recommend them. The battery life is good but if you are on an airplane for longer than two hours, make sure you bring a back up because it will be a good possibility that they will now last for the whole trip."

Black Friday air pod purchase,Tee,5,2023-11-27,I was confused going in to it with how to get them for that price so I got discouraged in the beginning until later that night I just added them to my cart and went to check out and it worked smoothly and I think it took me maybe a day to get them I had them at my door when I woke up would definitely recommend 10/10

"Quality brand, good sound.",omaro18,4,2023-11-26,The sound quality and connectivity are great. Comfort was good but the longer stem can be a bit awkward. The battery life was fine until our case died after a year or so which also meant no coverage. They are a bit pricey but you can find a good deal now since they are an older generation.

Rod Wave sounds angelic with these piecessss,krystal,5,2023-11-26,"OK I don't wanna overdo it, because I believe in things being overpriced. I was pleasantly surprised to find these headphones not only met my expectations, but exceeded them. At first, I thought I was dreaming, but then I realized as I put on my Rod wave album, it was angelic. I could hear it all I could hear every boom tap tsk played on the track. I believe these headphones even gave me the ability to dance better I'm really out here moving."

,kristina,4,2023-11-26,This was definitely a good buy but the only thing is that they arrived in new condition but so dusty with dusty particles on the buds and the case had to clean them before I could use them but other than that they work wonderfully
I was so scared,Flora,5,2023-11-26,The bad reviews had me nervous about buying these but they were fine and I love it ( make sure that it is sealed)
Nothing like the Pro,Jodi,2,2023-11-26,I lost my AirPod pro and decided to cheap out on these AirPods when they were about $60. All I have to say is don't be cheap like me! They fell out of my ears constantly and the background noise is quite noticeable. I'm planning on exchanging them for the pro if they let me.
Extremely Displeased,Parker,1,2023-11-26,"These are not 2nd Gen Airpods they are first gen. When I first ordered they said they would arrive the next day then arrived 2 weeks later. I don't usually expect this from Walmart, very annoyed."

No delivery. No explanation. No refund/replacement,Robbie,1,2023-11-25,"I ordered several items 2 were to be delivered today. Both show that they were delivered. However only one was actually delivered. When I called to see why, I was put on hold for 21 minutes and then after I explained the situation I was put back on hold for another 6 minutes only to be told to call back in 48 hours to initiate a refund or replacement. The only explanation was that sometimes things are marked as delivered before they actually arrive at their destination. Here's an idea‚Ä¶deliver the items before you mark them as delivered‚Ä¶.i guess I'll wait 48 hours so I can initiate a refund and then wait 7-10 days for my money and then the item won't be the same price because it was a Black Friday deal. This is why I use Amazon"

Love and Hate my AirPods,Alicia,5,2023-11-25,"I love my AirPods. I have a big family so when everyone is on an electronic device we all compete for volume so we can hear what we are watching. I bought 4 AirPods and now and my home is quiet. Problem now is we are all too involved with what we are watching and when someone talks that person gets ignored and I cannot monitor what's being watched/listened to. As a product I recommend this especially if you hate wires, not being able to charge your phone while simultaneously listening to something, or it's just loud in your home. But if you are big monitoring what everyone is watching or listening to then this is not the product to have."
"Pickup not received, no refund resolution",Prem,1,2023-11-25,"My attempt to purchase AirPods Pro 2 from Walmart became an appalling experience marked by sheer disappointment and lack of resolution.

Despite my insistence that I had never received the product, the store manager's explanations during the chaos of Black Friday left me without a solution. Escalating the issue through Walmart's customer center proved futile. An hour-long wait yielded no assistance or provision of a complaint ID for follow-up.

BEST DEAL!,Cynthia,5,2023-11-24,"I loved my AirPods, and don't ask me how I lost them, but I did. I still had my charging case, and I was surprised when I opened it and they were gone. Sooo. I had to replace them, and I found these on sale for $69 and snagged them right up. These are just like my original ones, and they are great earbuds! Love ‚Äòem!"
charging case,Jose,2,2023-11-24,charging case drains fast
%231 hands down,lekishia,5,2023-11-24,"Well this is my 3rd pair. Not because I don't still have the 1st 2 that were bought. The first pair I use religiously everyday but the second pair my husband ruined one AirPod, somehow and so they are very low so you can't talk or hear the person on the phone. But these are a long time coming. I had the first pair since 2019. So I deserved a new pair. Thanks to Walmart's early Black Friday sale I paid only $69. Yayyyy!!! Thanks Walmart"
I would recommend to a person that listens to music often for great sound quality and comfort.,matthewa53,3,2023-11-24,I had my AirPods for a year before they stopped charging. I went through 3 pairs since 2018 and they have great sound quality and fit very comfortably and snug in your ears. The AirPods have quite a long connection range before cutting out. The design it great to fit in your pocket on the go and charge while you walk place to place.
Great AirPods,Ibemags956,5,2023-11-24,I go through AirPods every year because I'm very aggressive with them and I listen to music everyday. I like the charge time on these. As always don't use them when too sweaty. Sound sounds great. I'd recommend to everyone.

,DANA,5,2023-11-24,Glad I purchased. This has made life at the gym so much easier. I don't have to spend time untangling wires. They stay in my ears. Others tend to fall out at times. Sound is good. Battery life is long.
,WalmartCustomer,4,2023-11-24,Because if I like this product and on sale in Walmart and good service for Walmart.
Exactly as advertised,Kyle,4,2023-11-24,"Delivered on time, exactly as ordered. Got an extra star because it was a better price than anywhere else at the time I ordered.

Terrific!!,Brooke,5,2023-11-23,What a price! I got the first generation right when they came out and finally one of the ear pieces stopped working after years of use. Well to replace one piece it was $45. So when these were on sale I decided it was cheaper in the long run to invest in another pair!! I love Apple products and thanks to Walmart I can afford them!
Pleased overall,Shanell,5,2023-11-23,"I purchased a pair of AirPods from Walmart a year ago, and the sound is going out in the right one . Hopefully these don't have the same issue. It does come with a charger, but no block. I got mine delivered and they arrived almost a week late."

Good sound and noise reduction,Carla,5,2023-11-22,Bought these as a gift for my husband. He likes that they don't have the rubber part that goes in his ear. He said they are comfortable and easy to use. Pairing was super easy. Can connect to multiple devices. Sound quality is very good.

Too uncomfortable to enjoy,kyyyra,2,2023-11-21,"I wanted to be a fan of Airpods but this product just didn't hit the spot for me. The sound quality was average, the charging case is a nice touch (although I wish the battery life lasted longer), and they stayed connected to my device decently well. However, the shape of the headphones is just wildly uncomfortable to me. I couldn't get them to stay in my ears and get good sound quality without hating the sensation and overall would not recommend this product."
,WalmartCustomer,5,2023-11-21,"The product has been sold out both in stores ad online for a while now. I had to pay extra, but it was still a better price than other stores."
Should have done it sooner,mindfire,5,2023-11-21,I absolutely love these. Not too loud and very comfortable. Double tapping answers a call or skips a song on Pandora. Just what I needed for hands free experience.

,WalmartCustomer,4,2023-11-20,The airpods are always a bit finicky and I wish the charge lasted longer. Overall they are fine.
These ‚Äúdeals‚Äù are a joke!!!!,Izzy,1,2023-11-20,"At the end of buying these airpods with the black friday ‚Äúdeals‚Äù and walmart , i saved 20-30 dollars‚Ä¶‚Ä¶. Walmart this must be a joke ü§¶üèΩ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è"
"Great value, long life, charge quickly",hollyj62,4,2023-11-19,I've had my AirPods for 4 years and have enjoyed using them. They connect to my phone quickly and the battery life is still pretty good considering their age. They charge incredibly fast in the case and the size is great. One negative is if you have smaller ears they are hard to get to stay in and often fall out if doing much movement.
They just work,bcapocelli,4,2023-11-19,"The pioneer in TWS, not the absolute best though. These are a great product for people immersed in the Apple ecosystem. Super easy to pair with iPhone. Battery life is decent and so is the sound. There are better audio quality TWS, but these are just easy!"
Great deal for a great product,Eve,5,2023-11-19,The Black Friday deal for this was hard not to purchase. They hold a charge for a long time. I use mine occasionally and charge it once a month. Can't wait to give as a gift this year.
Worth the money!,Kiki,5,2023-11-19,"I got these during the Black Friday sale however I would have gladly paid the original price anyways! The sound quality is wonderful regardless of what you're listening to, I have already put so many hours on these in such a short time! Audio books or heavy metal, the sound quality is crisp and clean. They are comfortable for long hours at a time, I fell asleep wearing them one night!"
Check good before buying. Or know what you are buy,Dolores,2,2023-11-19,"Not what I expected, first time buying. I should look further before buying. Not satisfied."
,Asaira,5,2023-11-19,came nicely sealed and packaged and its a Christmas gift for my sister so im not sure if theres any issues with the product but it doesnt look opened and like anything is missing so im sure everything is ok with it!
So far it works great,Massa,5,2023-11-19,"I've had my AirPods for 3 days now I believe and it works great, the battery lasts a great amount I can talk on the phone and ppl can hear me and overall it's the perfect size. This is my 3 rd time buying these cause I lost my first pair and after 4 years the second one started acting up so let's hope these last! They come with the charging rope and the case as well plus the box %26 instructions basically everything you'd get it with at the Apple Store"
Poor function,Gary,1,2023-11-19,Right ear volume very low compared to left ear
great price!,Billy,5,2023-11-19,These were a Birthday gift for our daughter. She was very happy with them and I was very pleased with the price!
Decent for the price.,Nelson,4,2023-11-19,Audio quality is good. Battery life could be a little better.
Awesome service,Pete,5,2023-11-19,"Walmart is the best thing since sliced bread. Fuel discounts. Online discounts. Barcode for in store price validations. In store and not know where something is? Search the app, it will tell you what isle to go to. Easy as 1, 2, 3."
,See,4,2023-11-19,Are these real Apple AirPods
,WalmartCustomer,5,2023-11-19,I was looking for this particular model and Walmart had it for a cheaper price than the other retailers.
"Driver probably took them
Back",shaynise,1,2023-11-19,"They were delivered, and fine when I got to the door (minutes). In the chat the rep said they'd refund them. In the phone the rep was incredibly rude said it wasn't their fault , and hung up on me. Needless to say‚Ä¶.."

Great deal for AirPods.,MrsR416,5,2023-11-19,Got these for my teen as a birthday gift and he loved them. Works great so far. Sound is crisp and has a microphone so it's great to listen to music and make calls.
Price is a steal,CB,5,2023-11-19,I was so skeptical about spending a lot on earbuds but when these went on sale I had to try them. They do not disappoint. I love them. The sound is so clear.

Upgrade over the originals,Greg,5,2023-11-19,These are great. I hade the originals for years and these ear pods are a bit nicer. Sounds seem better.
Terry,Perry,1,2023-11-19,I thought these had the esr buds but they don't. I don't want them. How do I return or switch out to the ones that do?
My favorite,Julie,5,2023-11-19,"These are ancient in terms of tech, I know, but keep buying them. A lot of them. I own a collection of Left airpods, as does my sister. It's not the fault of Apple, or its product; we are apparently genetically incapable of retaining a right airpod. Likewise, these‚Äîlike all brands, no matter what solutions attempted‚Äîfall out of our ears. However, again, this is a personal issue, and these are superior to alternatives, and are affordable, especially it you catch a sale. For people who have a more discerning ear, and taste in tech, these are maybe too old school, I'm not sure. For my purposes, they are great. Cleaning them is difficult, but it's the nature of the product."
Black Friday  Deal!,BooBoo,5,2023-11-19,My son lives in Texas saw these on sale online but they were sold out. so i checked here they were on sale on line in my state that was truly a great deal

My Apple AirPods,Rachel,4,2023-11-19,I can hear very clear with the AirPods but they are a bit awkward fitting in my ears.
,Me,5,2023-11-18,These are great. Dont need latest and greatest these work perfectly. I've had a pair for a year without issues. Grabbed another pair as a gift when these went on sale. Couldn't pass them up for $69.
Hands free and great fit earbuds!,Anna,5,2023-11-18,These AirPods work great for me! Keeps me hands free while on the move. I love being able to tap one headphone to mute the sound!
Unacceptable,Mario,1,2023-11-18,"Don't buy, it's a scam. I bought a set of apple AirPods 2nd gen with wireless charging case. When delivery driver knocked on door, got my package. It had been opened and repackaged. I open and my AirPods package was missing, I call the the Walmart help center. Gentleman answered phone, I explained to him my situation. All he could do for me was issue refund. He offered a $25 gift card, but when I tried to use it it was invalid. All I have to say is poor customer service to the fullest. Never in my life have I experienced poor customer service like today. I'm so disappointed this will get escalated to the BBR. I don't leave bad reviews but today I've had it. Thank you Walmart. It was suppose to be my sons Xmas gift, we were short on cash so when I seen the promo Black Friday deal for $69.00 I jumped on it and thought I scored, sad to find out that such a huge company couldn't replace the lost AirPods. Instead a refund was issued and a fake $25 gift card lol. What a joke Walmart."
My Grandson was ecstatic!,Sherry,5,2023-11-18,"He had been wearing ONE of his sister's old AirPods for a few weeks because she lost one of them. I had bought these new ones for his Christmas. When he came over to my house and he was wearing only one, I couldn't stand it. I went ahead and gave them to him. He was so surprised and appreciative!"

Quality pair of buds ü´ßüéß,hhaaylie,4,2023-11-18,"These wireless earbuds are a good choice for you or your child's first pair. I love how fast they connect to your phone, as long as your Bluetooth is turned on, as soon as you open the AirPod case they want to connect to your device. The sound quality is fair, I know there are louder and more sound proof ones on the market but these are a cheaper alternative to those. The battery life is fair. I do feel like the earbuds themselves kind of die a lot but all you have to do is shove them in the case and let them charge for a bit. They definitely get the job done and are convenient for iPhone or iPad users. üéßüé∂"
Horrible,brandy,1,2023-11-18,"It's like they are refurbished, and the pod case does not stay charged as if I was to buy it out of the Apple store"
Best purchase yet!,mayra,5,2023-11-18,This is grate for pre-teens to use very easy and will not connect to any other device other than the divice it was intended for.
Price parity difficult to find,Pritesh,3,2023-11-18,With exponentially high price compared to competition the quality is atmost average to good only.

The best earbuds,BigR,5,2023-11-18,I have had several pairs of these apple earbuds. Now wearing my 5th pair. All of the previous ones were my fault for loosing or breaking them. I put one pair through the washing machine and the dryer and they still worked!!

Faulty Product Recieved!!!,Sadaf,1,2023-11-17,"Ordered them because they were on the Black Friday Deal, and after receiving and using them for like couple weeks, the right airpod looses battery after like 5 minutes of use, and the charging case hardly lasts for a day. Very unhappy and disappointed and I will be returning them as soon I get the time!!!"
First time Airpod owner,Jarred,5,2023-11-17,I am pleased as a write this review after only using twice. The fit is very different from samsung buds. I don't find them falling out often.
Great sound but not the best feel,ronnieh10,3,2023-11-17,Apple AirPods are good earbuds. But for the price I wish they were a little better. I know they have come out with new and maybe they fixed some of the problems. I felt like the sound quality was great but the hard plastic hurt my ears after wearing them for so long. Also I would have trouble keeping them in my ears. But I have not tried the newer ones so I'm not sure about them.
Thumbs of from us,Michelle,5,2023-11-17,My mom and kids loves them . They love the convenience and perfect fit . They said the sound is great and they would certainly recommend them.

Airpods,rio,4,2023-11-17,should come with a charger box
They okay,chinita_jay13,3,2023-11-17,"Honestly at times I just preferred the ones with the cord. Ofcourse this concept is great but I've literally drop them on the plane and it was a mission to find. Other than that they work great and the way we can block any noise on calls is amazing. They do last a while after a charge, now if you didn't charge them than you are out of luck which again is why I miss the old ones with the cord."

They okay,chinita_jay13,3,2023-11-17,"Honestly at times I just preferred the ones with the cord. Ofcourse this concept is great but I've literally drop them on the plane and it was a mission to find. Other than that they work great and the way we can block any noise on calls is amazing. They do last a while after a charge, now if you didn't charge them than you are out of luck which again is why I miss the old ones with the cord."
Finally apple,Rhea,4,2023-11-17,Finally got apple airpod on a good deal‚Ä¶

MY  AIRPODS NEVER CAME,Derrick,1,2023-11-16,"Walmart I ordered my AirPods and only got the case ,"
Just okay,Tracy,2,2023-11-16,I was really excited about getting AirPods but I think I should have gotten the Pros. These have good sound and they are of good quality but they are terribly uncomfortable. They hurt my ears while I am using them and they fall out if I move around any at all. Will probably end up buying something different.

Excellent delivery and service.,Janis,5,2023-11-16,These are a gift for my grandson so I haven't opened them. They arrived as expected and the packaging looks great. I received excellent service.
"Didn't get my order, awful shopping experience",Hsinyu,1,2023-11-16,"Very awful experience. I bought the stuff at a black Friday discounted price ($69). The Walmart system shows that my AirPods 2 have arrived, but I haven't received them at all. The customer service agent said she could only help me process a refund, and I had to buy the stuff again by myself. However, the Black Friday special price for AirPods 2 has ended, and it has increased from $69 back to $99. Walmart's irresponsible attitude is shocking and disappointing."

Com %23 and after talking to 2 people I was told even though I ordered and was shipped only 1 they couldn't help me and that I had to go to the store because they stated that's where it came from. After 4 calls I was told to talk to the managers which would be in the next day. And they weren't. All I wanted was they remainder of my order. I went into the store and they were sold out. I was so upset. I don't feel that it is my fault that you only shipped one when everyone checked I stated two. If anyone can help that would be great

Always mistakes. Doesn't feel worth it,nw,2,2023-11-15,"Sunday my order was missing $95 worth of groceries. The delivery person just didn't deliver despite them being shopped. Had to spend 30 minutes figuring out how to get a refund plus the inconvenience of the fact the groceries were meant to go home w my college aged son and that didn't end up happening. Today I got 4 white onions and 3 red delicious apples. I ordered 3 sweet onions and 6 Honeycrisp. Got ripped off pretty much. These weren't even listed at substitutes. Just shopped wrong. Doesn't really feel worth the hassle. If I wanted the wrong items, I would just send my husband to the store and then I wouldn't even have to tip him. Frustrating for sure."

Great call quality.,maryj231,4,2023-11-15,"The built-in microphones effectively reduce background noise, ensuring your voice comes through loud and clear. Whether you're taking calls or interacting with Siri, the AirPods deliver a consistently reliable performance. I will definitely recommend ."
Airpods 2nd Gen,AD,5,2023-11-15,What I liked about these airpods is that they are very small and can fit anywhere you go/ they are wireless. They are also very comfortable. The only thing I would change is they are a little bit big on the ears and also have some glitch in sound but not much. Overall they are a 5 star. :)

Easy to use headphones,savagemomof2,4,2023-11-14,"I purchased this product when it first released to the market, and have had no problems with them. The sound quality is clear and crisp. The battery life was long lasting up until recently, as the product ages, the batteries do not seem to hold a charge for more than a few hours. The design is sleek and clean, and they are extremely comfortable. The headphones are extremely easy to connect the first time and then they pretty much connect on their on after.

I have already given up on this item, but my wife insists on purchasing it because she loves it, despite its poor quality. The two oldest ones had the same issue: after 6 to 7 months of use, one of the microphones starts to malfunction. The experience at the Apple Store is horrible; it takes a really long time to fill out all the necessary information, and even then, there is no guarantee that they will replace the equipment. Last time, I wasted around 5 hours filling out guarantee forms, talking with someone from Apple, driving to the nearest Apple Store, and dealing with the representative there. With the same amount of time, I could have purchased some units of that item if they were working."

,WalmartCustomer,5,2023-11-11,The apple AirPod is a useful product for everyone to used when we are in a private call and the price is very good for us to buy it that's why I rate a 5
Perfect,,5,2023-11-11,"Well, perfect, of course. I got these for my father after YEARS of trying to convince him! After all the years wasted on getting ANY other brand or kind (over a decade %26 a half), those have amounted to MUCH more than the price of these anyway because they have to be replaced so much. Other brands of earbuds DON'T stay in your ears, and they just simply DO NOT have as good a sound! Not even Beats has better sound. (I don't know, perhaps they got better since their initial launch, but I never looked back ever since then and the hype.) NONE have been better than Apple's choices over the years. So, I'm just glad he finally got some. And, just like I thought, he could not be happier and now he knows he can wear earbuds again. (He suffered a lot of injuries in the military that he worked for decades to heal and one makes his ears hurt when he wears earbuds or even over-the-ear headphones. I told him that I REALLY think THESE won't! And guess what? I was right! He's so delighted that they DON'T hurt his ears, and that, YES, they STAY IN! And sound phenomenal.)

Worth the money!!,pynniee,4,2023-11-11,"The sound quality is awesome!! easy to connect to bluetooth and the design looks fancy. However, the battery life after 2 years is so bad as many Apple's product."

Perfect,,5,2023-11-11,"Well, perfect, of course. I got these for my father after YEARS of trying to convince him! After all the years wasted on getting ANY other brand or kind (over a decade %26 a half), those have amounted to MUCH more than the price of these anyway because they have to be replaced so much.

,KerShauna,1,2023-11-11,"I am not satisfied with this order at all. I ordered these AirPods for pickup at the Baker Walmart, and when i arrived i put that i was at pickup slot %235 and a few minutes later i got a message saying that the order has been picked up but i never received them. I ordered these during the Black Friday sale, and now they are out of stock. I am highly dissatisfied!"
,Felecia,4,2023-11-11,I liked how they told me that my package would come one day later and not just saying any thing
,WalmartCustomer,5,2023-11-11,"Why I think they are original and especially the discounted price, is what motivates me to buy at Walmart for their low prices in relation to quality"
FedEx sucks,vincent,1,2023-11-11,Everything is going fine till FedEx came into the deal. Package was ruined. An item was missing so that's great.
,WalmartCustomer,5,2023-11-11,I lost mine and the price was fantastic keep up the good work thank you for providing the best happy upcoming holidays God bless you. Whoever you read this or maybe it will be to the file God bless you
Disappointed and frustrated,Annette,1,2023-11-11,"I am very disappointed In Walmart. When I place the order the Apple AirPods was available for me to pickup today and to wake up to a message on my iPhone at 6:12am telling me you have 3 items not available. You knew that last night why not text me then, so now my children cannot get the AirPods I promised them, and no secondly they say they can ship, then when go to ship it says we cannot shipped to your address. Basically they are out everywhere. So disappointed. Stop false advertising for items you know good dog gone well y'all don't have. I bet you all will have the 99.00 to 149.00 in stock real soon and I am sure I will be able to pickup curbside and they can be shipped. Thanks for nothing."

Terrible experience with Walmart,Jerry,1,2023-11-11,I suggest not shopping at Walmart. I had to order online to pick up local and then could not pick up till next day. Not sure how people or companies have become so brain dead. They had the item right there but would not give it to me till the next day. I had no choice then to cancel my order. I spoke with every manager and also called customer service. Absolutely no help even though they knew I was leaving the state in the morning and would not be able to come back. Pure ignorance. Very disappointed in Walmart and their employees.
,WalmartCustomer,5,2023-11-11,The price is the lowest I have ever seen for AirPods. I bought multiples of Thai products for my kids.

Horrible!!! Driver delivered to the wrong house.,Cristina,1,2023-11-10,"This was a horrible experience the driver delivered my package to the wrong address. Despite the fact that outside my house, there are big numbers that you can see clearly to not mistake my house with somebody else. This package was my Apple AirPods that I waited to order on the early Black Friday sale and it's limited to one per customer so now because of the drivers mistake I am no longer able to order my AirPods. This was suppose to be my early birthday gift to myself as I am a mom and a student I never get anything for me and this time that I did it was delivered to the wrong address. How do you mess up an address when the gps takes you? It is ridiculous that this is an issue how can someone mess up a delivery with a pair of Apple AirPods."

Favorite version of AirPods,Michael,5,2023-11-10,"These are my absolute favorite AirPods. They are more comfortable for me than the 3rd generation AirPods and honestly my favorite feature is that I can interact with them by tapping whereas any other AirPods require me to either squeeze the stem or slide my finger on them somehow. They don't have noise cancellation but that just means if I wear them in the car I don't have to worry about turning that feature off. Yes, I wish they were USB-C like my iPhone but I have plenty of lightning cables in my house to charge them."

Highly disappointed,Stephanie,1,2023-11-10,I'm highly disappointed with your company. I purchased some Apple iPods and your delivery person claimed they dropped them off at my front door. Which is not true my camera shows no one left any package at my door. I will NEVER order from your company again. I suggest you all start doing background checks on these 3rd parties that you all hire to deliver.

Eh,erins254,2,2023-11-07,These are awful ear buds for the price. They will not connect to my iPhone. I finally used my warranty and got an upgraded pair of pros. They wrk slightly better but they still fall out of my ears
Quality of sound,brynnag3,1,2023-11-07,The sound quality lasted for about a year until I had to turn it up all the way. Battery life was good. It was fit in my ear good. Connecting was easy to do and I like the design.

Good quality but could be better,iridianl2,4,2023-11-05,The sound quality is great for an everyday experience but the battery life is good and I don't have to constantly charge it. The bad thing is they fall off my ear but the design is small and easy to lose if forgetful.
AirPods are amazing,lauraf358,4,2023-11-05,These AirPods connected seamlessly with my iPhone. The battery lasted a long time and the design is minimal and easy to keep up with. The sound quality is fantastic and the comfort in my ears was great.

"Light, compact, and easy to use",rebecam87,4,2023-11-03,"Really convenient, and connects easy too. They're light and comfortable for everyday wear. Sound is okay, could be improved. I also like the long battery life!"
Very easy to use and carry,sneha12356,4,2023-11-03,These airpods are so easy to use and carry around. I used to use my headphones all the time which are so difficult to store in small bags. Additionally it also has a nice noise cancelling feature that lets me work regardless of the people around me.
Okay!,elliet11,3,2023-11-03,"They are just ok. Earwax gets build up very easily in these and it muffles the sound. They don't stay out that well and do fall out, which can get very frustrating. Definitely not my favorite"
It's not the most comfortable thing to put in your ear,alexandrag297,3,2023-11-03,"I don't understand all the hype about them. They are good in the batteries. Good but the sound quality is OK. I wouldn't say that it's the best. also, when you start working out sweating, I feel like the sound gets worse. ÔøºÔøº"

Disappointed,Celeste,1,2023-11-02,It has just been a little over a month since I bought these. Already the left one doesn't work. This was money wasted.

Terrible‚Äîthere was nothing in this package,DARIA,1,2023-10-31,Opened the package when I needed the item to gift. There was only parts of boxes and cords in the box. Contacted Walmart and they refuse to refund
Ok,linao23,3,2023-10-30,I don't like that they are easy to lose. And I have small ears so they don't stay in well. But the sound quality is really good. And they are way easier to travel in.
Get them:)!,pamelar108,4,2023-10-30,"Pretty much simple to use and the easiest one to get, they do sound really good and are comfortable to use, they get charged pretty quickly and the battery lasts for a while"
Replacement of AirPods,Willa,5,2023-10-30,I am very pleased with my purchase. I use these everyday. They are great; charge up really quick. Would highly recommend.

"Good sound, little overpriced",hassana13,4,2023-10-30,"They sound really good and I love ability to amplifying background noise so your not walking around deaf, you can hear the outside noises and music. I always lose them though. They have really good sound but for the price you can get a lot of other earphones cheaper which are on par , very close , or even better. However if you like apple products and have the money to spend go for it!"
They're good,Bernard,5,2023-10-29,"I got these during a sale week, price was around $89. It does what it's supposed to do. Battery life isn't the best."

No,Ty,2,2023-10-28,"They been on the charger all night, been using them for 3-4 hours and already dying. They die extremely fast and don't always connect immediately."
Good Sound,tranv8,4,2023-10-28,"Apple AirPods 2 has a completely unchanged design compared to the first generation AirPods model. And since they don't change, it's hard to tell them apart. Overall we have a very good design with elements that are compact in size, comfortable to wear on the ears and not stuffy when worn for long periods of time. The adhesion of AirPods 2 has increased a bit, but it is still not a suitable product for use when jogging or exercising. The charging box has also not changed, except for the addition of wireless charging (the charging box has an indicator light on the outside)."

Uneven Sound,carleyw19,4,2023-10-27,"I like that they are wireless and stay in my ears. After a while, one side was more quiet than the other. The design is sleek and simple. I used a case with mine to help keep track of them."
Not the best out there,kaarinalizeth,3,2023-10-27,They are good for what they are but they are definitely over-priced. I like them but wouldn't rebuy if I lost this current pair. They could be more comfortable.
Decent does the job,myu87,3,2023-10-27,"I think the original AirPods lasted me for about three years without a doubt, but small cracks here and there and the audio keeps zooming in and out as it got older. It is comfortable and it seems like it's been reliable but now with the connectivity and unreliability with spottyness Ôøº it might be time to upgrade. Ôøº"
NOT a wireless a charging case,Claire,4,2023-10-27,"The AirPods are great, the only thing about them is that the AirPod case is actually NOT wireless charging. The name was a little confusing"
Its okay,vikhanhh1,3,2023-10-27,"The quality got bad because the sound leak, but battery last pretty long, conect quickly, the design is nice and convenient, not recommend using while exercising"

The sound is so good,autmndawndye,4,2023-10-27,"I had these for years before I upgraded to my pro and honestly I like them better, the box picks up the headpiece instantly and charged them easily. Picks up the sound and drowns out the sounds around you like the noise cancel is so good"
Decent sound,christinat228,4,2023-10-26,Decent sound emits from these. Are they comfortable? Not really. They hurt my ears a little but oh well. They serve their purpose and k suppose that's what really matters
Fast shipping,Brittany,3,2023-10-25,So far from packaging product looked great haven't opened yet because they are for my sons for Christmas. But shipping was great
AirPods,Victor,4,2023-10-25,This is my 5th pair their good headphones as long as you don't lose them.
Alright,M,4,2023-10-25,I got it on sale for 90$ but I think it could have been a better deal. The second generation is old compared to all the new ones so I think it should be on sale for a cheaper price rather than 10$ off. OfferUp is selling brand new ones for way less.
My new AirPods,Helen,5,2023-10-25,I lost my AirPods and I bought a new pair with apple locators! So now I don't have to worry about losing my AirPods!!! Thanks Walmart

Best earbuds on the market,maddiem234,4,2023-10-22,The AirPods are comfortable and play music pretty loud. They can get messed up pretty easy but they're the best pair on the market right now. I recommend a buy
Good but need constant TLC,jennyb284,4,2023-10-22,"I can't go back to regular wired headphones since switching to AirPods. However, I do find sometimes that if you do not clean religiously (and correctly!!) they can be less effective, and will only work in certain positions."

No more tangled wires and just beautiful music with Air Pods,eddier126,4,2023-10-20,"It's dancing time with Apple Airpods. These innovative headphones, offer high definition crisp clean sounds without the tangling of wires that you get from traditional head phones. That way you can dance to your favorite tunes on your iPod or iPhone without tripping into a cord. You can even use it to answer any calls without picking up your phone just by connecting the pods to the phone with the blue tooth feature. It gives you great sound quality for hours and you just dock it on its chargeable stand at the end of the day. I literally can't leave home without this product, thank you Apple."
Worth the Price and Hype,henryc0812,4,2023-10-20,"I recently got my hands on the Apple AirPods with Charging Case, and I have to admit that they've completely exceeded my expectations. These earbuds have truly transformed the way I experience music and stay connected on the go. First and foremost, the convenience of these AirPods is unbeatable. They seamlessly connect to my Apple devices the moment I open the case, and the setup was a breeze. I love how they automatically pause playback when I remove one from my ear and start again when I put it back in. It's a small feature, but it makes a significant difference in my daily use. The sound quality is impressive as well. The audio is clear, crisp, and the bass is surprisingly good for earbuds of this size. Whether I'm listening to my favorite tunes, podcasts, or even taking calls, the sound quality is consistently top-notch. I can even use Siri hands-free, which is incredibly useful for quick commands and questions. Battery life has been more than sufficient for my daily needs. The Charging Case provides multiple charges, and I find that I rarely run out of battery during the day. The quick charge feature is fantastic, providing several hours of listening time with just a short charge. In terms of comfort, they fit snugly in my ears and are lightweight, making them perfect for extended use. I've used them during workouts, commutes, and even on long flights, and they stay in place without any discomfort. The build quality is what you'd expect from Apple ‚Äì solid and reliable.

That they last a long time,maryamj27,3,2023-10-19,They last for a good time I enjoy using them at work. You put one in your ear it will last 3 hours and even at a low sound you'll be able to listen to music and be able to cooperate with customers. If you don't like the white case you can get any case color with a lot of varieties.

Not comfy,beesleezy,1,2023-10-19,Not a huge fan of these I always lose one without having the cord. They really aren't very comfortable or wearable in my opinion. I know allot of people do enjoy them
"Great, wish they didn't break after a year or so!",ellies136,4,2023-10-18,"I just wish they were less expensive! They work so well with Apple products, are small and comfortable in the ear. Perfect for the gym. Decent battery life and love the portable charging case. The only this is that they definitely have a shelf life. After about 18 months they stop working. It's like clockwork! At that point I have to go back to my trusty wired ear buds, pictured."
"Allergic reaction, Connection issues.",everydayaliz,3,2023-10-18,"The apple AirPods were my first purchase. I have an iPhone, iPad, iPod and macbook pro. Normally, I keep the Bluetooth on at home on my devices. My complaint here, is that if I was using them while on my phone and my kids picked up the iPad, it would connect to the 2nd device automatically. I tried to avoid this problem by purchasing a second pair of AirPods, the pro version, but unfortunately the same thing happened. We can't use different AirPods on devices connected to the same account. One of the AirPods earbud also stopped responding just a few weeks after purchase. The charging case also went bad after a few months of use. I would carefully keep these clean and free of debris but as of today, it only works when it wants to. They are also not safe for ear sensitive people. I would get pain and discomfort along with an allergic reaction in my ear canals after every use. It might be the material they are made of. Aside of that, the sound was good. The fit is not universal. Battery life was good. I could use them up to four hours."

Nope.,BTM,1,2023-10-18,Left side of AirPod did not work. When I returned it 2 days after getting it the girl at the return counter kept inspecting it when it was clearly returned with everything and only tried to use it one day.
Personal opinion to me is it could be a more comfy fit,rachelm775,3,2023-10-17,"If I had my AirPods still I would have posted a photo of them but I actually gave them away to my sister because I have to say, I just can't have plastic sitting in my ear like that. It doesn't have a cushion of much and I am someone who has to feel like whatever is in their ear is going to stay there. I know they are made to sit there and not fall out but I need something that's going to stick in my ear. Ôøºand with these I just didn't have that confidence in them and decided to let my sister get some use out of them instead! Overall, if you are someone who doesn't mind the feeling of a looser earbud these would be perfect for you!"
Won't own any other ear buds,Rowena,5,2023-10-17,"Absolutely love these, the price difference between these and the more expensive ones are so big and the differences in features negligible."

Good for on the go,beccak39,3,2023-10-17,They're good and have good sound quality. They last pretty long as well without charging which is a plus. They're quick to connect to your phone after paired. They do begin to hurt my ears after a while of wearing them though

Delivered open,Layla,3,2023-10-17,My package was delivered opened. The cut indicates it was cut with a box opener.
Good for the price. A basic good quality headphone,trangn26,4,2023-10-17,"Great sound quality and super light on my ears. However, it does hurt my ears after using it for few hours. Very easy to connect to my phone. One time charge can last few hours used"
comfort,brandidxwn,3,2023-10-17,"only headphones that fit in my ear perfectly! battery life is pretty fantastic & the sound quality is great at the beginning but as you go on, it lessens but that's bound to happen"

Personal opinion to me is it could be a more comfy fit,rachelm775,3,2023-10-17,"If I had my AirPods still I would have posted a photo of them but I actually gave them away to my sister because I have to say, I just can't have plastic sitting in my ear like that. It doesn't have a cushion of much and I am someone who has to feel like whatever is in their ear is going to stay there. I know they are made to sit there and not fall out but I need something that's going to stick in my ear. Ôøºand with these I just didn't have that confidence in them and decided to let my sister get some use out of them instead! Overall, if you are someone who doesn't mind the feeling of a looser earbud these would be perfect for you!"

Great quality & comfort!,jennanikkole,4,2023-10-16,"These are great for walking or working out, with them being cordless the design keeps you tangle free while moving around! They're very loud and have a clear sound without any muffled noise! I only have to charge mine about twice a week, so that's super convenient! I LOVE my AirPods. The only reason for 4 stars is that they are a little bit expensive, but you definitely get what you pay for!"

AirPods Great Buy Great Price,Emily R,5,2023-10-16,Great buy great price. I walked in to Sam's hoping to find a sale on AirPods as my son and I had just lost ours. So now I was having to purchase two pairs. I walk in and find two left at a great price. They were the older generation BUT they work perfect for us. And being a budget right now the price was great!

,WalmartCustomer,1,2023-10-13,Because the local store gave my package to someone else and did not even apologize and said they could not help me at all.

Works well,joyofthings,4,2023-10-12,The sound is great. Long lasting. It sometimes has trouble connecting if I'm not on wifi but will eventually. It's a little harder to use just one earbud.

They're okay!,divinepie,3,2023-10-11,They are pretty cool and have good sound quality but they're just not my favorite. They fall out of my ears easily and aren't that comfortable. I rather wear headphones that don't go inside the ear.
Best Deal Ever,strangerthingsfanatic,5,2023-10-11,"The sound is amazing and the easy task of just opening the charging box, it connects with the Iphone on iOS 17! It's an original apple product! N the price was amazing! Would recommend to others!"

Overpriced,hpucely515,3,2023-10-10,"Overall I loved my AirPods for the sound quality (at least at first). As time went on, the sound quality diminished due to buildup on the speakers. I struggled with cleaning them, as often buildup would just get jammed into the mesh. They are fairly comfortable, but also fall out super easily and working out with them was impossible without risking one falling under my equipment. I probably wouldn't shell out so much money again for this design of AirPods, specifically. I haven't tried the newer ones so I'm sure many issues have been fixed as years have gone on. The newer versions look much easier to clean and like they won't fall out of your ears."
Worth the cost!,williamb71,4,2023-10-09,"Great first wireless ear pods. Used while running for years, finally the sweat got to them and sound turned static. Definitely got the moneys worth out of them!"
Bang for your buck?,lucyo41,4,2023-10-09,Easy to slip in your pocket on the go but it you're looking for something soundproof these are not for you. The battery lasts days but sometimes it is a little difficult to connect to your device but maybe it's just a me issue..
Love these,kaylap382,4,2023-10-09,"I love using these. The sound is amazing and the change does last awhile. Only downfall is if you lose one air pod, you can't use anything to help find it like find my app."
Very good for price,carlosc104,4,2023-10-09,They work very well for the price and is good for anyone wanting a apple headphones they have good battery life good comfort and quality and they connect instantly

Great sound and comfortable . Connectivity can occasionally give you some trouble.,heathers795,4,2023-10-09,I never thought I wanted them until I had them. So great! Battery life is long. They are comfortable in the ears. Design is nice and easy to add a fun case. Sound is great. Connectivity is the only problem I run into occasionally. One ear but won't work. I have to peer down my phone and reconnect.
That they fall out yours easily and don't really have a good grip,sophic2,3,2023-10-08,The sound one these AirPods are nice there loud but a little static. They get lost easily and fall out easily as will. The battery life sucks on these AirPods they don't long last at all. But the connectivity is really easy and doesn't take long. I would rather go with the AirPod max pros as to these are really easy to fall out of your ears.

So covenient for daily use!,elmis,4,2023-10-06,This ear phones are pretty good at noise cancelling. And I like how the battery life last me almost a week because of the the case. Its pretty comfortable on and stays on while working out.
,WalmartCustomer,5,2023-10-06,"So far, the AirPods are working perfectly. I've only had them for a day, so hopefully they stay perfect for me."
daily headphone still a solid choice!,tuccimad,4,2023-10-06,"my daily headphone if i'm choosing to wear them. i've worn them for workouts and I have to say the sound can't be beat. I give four stars because over the years the battery doesn't last as long, and it's a little uncomfortable to keep in your ears for a long period of time. I think the new version solves this issue however, but I haven't yet invested."
Great,kiml149,4,2023-10-05,Great sound quality - comfy in ears and has a super long battery life. Love using this at the gym and for daily activities like talking on the phone
I think there's better products in the market,rabiak12,3,2023-10-05,"They're not terrible but within a year, the sound quality significantly decreased. I thought I was going deaf. The battery life was pretty good though."
Wireless Freedom and Crystal-Clear Sound - Apple AirPods 2nd Gen Redefine the Earbud Experience,indum3,4,2023-10-05,"Sound Quality: The sound quality of these AirPods is clear and crisp, making music, podcasts, and calls enjoyable. While not audiophile-level, they perform admirably for everyday use. Connectivity: One of the standout features is the seamless connectivity with Apple devices. They connect instantly, and the transition between devices is smooth. It's a time-saver. Battery Life: The battery life is decent, offering several hours of playback and talk time on a single charge. The case provides additional charges on the go, which is convenient. Comfort and Convenience: The lightweight design and comfortable fit make these AirPods easy to wear for extended periods. They stay securely in my ears during various activities, and the convenience of just popping them in is a time-saver. Affordability: What really appealed to me was the fact that these AirPods strike a balance between quality and affordability. I didn't want to break the bank, and these earbuds fit my budget while delivering reliable performance. Overall, the second-generation AirPods are reliable, everyday earbuds that offer good sound quality, seamless Apple device integration, and comfort. Also pretty durable as I've dropped them a few times on hard surfaces and they don't have a scratch on them. Their convenience factor, affordability, and solid performance make them an excellent choice for those who want a hassle-free wireless earbud experience without the extravagant price tag."

Great overall product,victoriaw276,3,2023-10-04,"The Apple AirPods are a fantastic addition to my tech collection. Their seamless connectivity and superb sound quality make listening to music a joy. The sleek design and comfortable fit make them perfect for extended use, and the convenience of the charging case is a game-changer. Overall, I highly recommend these AirPods for anyone looking to elevate their audio experience. Only reason I gave them 3 stars is because they are super uncomfortable in my ears and fall out a lot- my battery also dies quite fast."
AirPods,Jacob,5,2023-10-03,a little overpriced but i love them works great and was brand new also game with 6 months of free apple music.
Simplistic,lucys34,4,2023-10-03,"Overall, I love the AirPods for their sleek and minimalist design. Their sound quality is excellent. There's no crackling sound. However, I've noticed that while they're comfortable, they tend to slip out of my ears during any vigorous activities. In terms of battery life, they last a couple of hours before needing da recharge, which can be annoying. However, my four-year-old pair still manages to hold a two-hour charge before requiring recharging."
The quality of the audio was amazing,Calvin,4,2023-10-03,I would recommend to get a case and if you still go to school don't put them in the little pocket put them in the biggest one
malfunction with right airpod,kentrina,1,2023-10-03,malfunction with right airpod the airpod does not connect automatically
Great,Lekesha,5,2023-10-02,They work great and charge fast. I can use them for long periods of time without problems so I'm satisfied
Great wireless headphones,billievdat,4,2023-10-02,I've had the AirPods for three years now and loved every second of it. The sound quality is great and I've been able to hear sounds I didn't know existed in songs with more clarity. It pairs up with all my apple devices like the iPad and Apple TV easily. The battery life is decent. I don't find myself charging it too often but I only use it in the gym 4 times a week. It's great for working out and stays comfortably in my ears when running. The only issue I've ran into so far is when I am transferring the sound from the car to my AirPods. It used to work seamlessly but now it won't automatically switch to the AirPods when I put them in my ear. I definitely recommend AirPods especially if you have other Apple products.
Outstanding audio features,jadeha88,4,2023-10-01,"Designed with a new curve and longer earbuds to help users easily insert them into their ears, have better grip, and not worry about falling out during exercise and Outstanding audio features."
Would recommend,urbandollyb_,4,2023-10-01,One of the best in the market! The noise canceling paired with the sound quality makes them one of my personal favorites. However after an hour I find that they can get super uncomfortable.

Awesome,amelia823,4,2023-09-30,"What a great product this is! I genuinely enjoy being able to use these when listening to music, a podcast, or even to focus in on homework! The battery lasts for a good amount of time before they are needed to be charged again. My only complaint is they get dirty quick; they need to be cleaned frequently. Other than that, I'd highly suggest investing your money into these!"
Would be great if they worked more than 2 weeks,Carole,2,2023-09-30,These worked for 2 weeks. Then the right one stopped working. I tried resetting. Tried everything I could find on the internet. But they would not communicate with my phone by opening the case and the right one would not charge. I returned them.
They're okay!,alexandrahq,3,2023-09-30,"The sound quality is okay but gets staticky after a while. The battery life is good and charges super fast, they are easy to use and portable. They are comfortable to use but could use some work."

I just worry it'll pop out of my ear and I'll lose it. It's happened as I've pushed my hair out of my face so idk. I sometimes feel like I have to be careful. Maybe it takes some getting used to."
Battery life is the best feature,laurab1027,4,2023-09-29,I like how the sound comes out of these ear buds and the battery life is great! I do not like how these tend to fall out of my ear T times and how they are not really compatible with my computer.
Great Air Pods,IvanB,5,2023-09-29,"I love these air pods, I can run and they don't fall from the ear, it sounds really good and with the price is a great deal!"

Good for what they are!,kelsih15,4,2023-09-28,So I've not had these long. I bought them after losing my 2nd Pros. In comparison there is no comparison. They fit well in my ears considering and they hold charge well. Sound is great as well but you should splurge if you can!
GOOD BUT EASILY FALL OUT OF MY EARS,linhn52,3,2023-09-28,I bought them a year ago and they work great . The sound quality but just one thing bother me is it realy easyly fall out of my ears. Love these headphones with a passion. Love the feature when they automatically quiet when you are talking to someone. Battery quite good for me .
These are really good!,josea137,4,2023-09-27,Honestly these AirPods are amazing they have lasted me a long time I've been having those AirPods for 3 years now and honestly I'm surprised they lasted that long!!
Not worth the price.,rocios140,3,2023-09-27,I like mg AirPods but the battery doesn't last very long. Also after a year my left AirPod started acting up which caused it to be staticky when trying to make a call. As well as preventing from anyone hearing me on the left AirPod. Over quality Is decent. I personally think there is better headphones out there for half the price.

Authentic Apple AirPods. Excellent!,Jenny,5,2023-09-27,You won't be disappointed with these. My family and I own the gen 2 AirPods and we all love them. These are authentic Apple products. I actually prefer these over the more expensive %26 newer Airpod models.

,WalmartCustomer,5,2023-09-26,"I opened them up as soon as I left, connected to my phone and loved the quality of the sound, I know that's an apples doing but still thanks for providing them, and loved the 30 bucks off when ordering online through the app"
,WalmartCustomer,5,2023-09-26,This product is a great one especially on my chart list and in a discounted price as compared to bestbuy
Not Good for small ears,elysiumfieldsbeauty,3,2023-09-26,"The Apple air Pods are not the most comfortable to wear in the ear, the tend to fall out within seconds of putting them in. I think Apple needs to design two variations of the pods so it can be easily used by other users with different size options."

Would not connect,Anonymous,1,2023-09-25,The devices would work some times and not the other times. Really bad for smaller ears as well. Just kept falling out
The sound jumps from one side to the other,Leslee,1,2023-09-25,They dont work
Nice but I upgraded,Mo,4,2023-09-25,Only returned because I decided to upgrade to the 3rd generation. Had more selections are far as good protective cases against toddlers and falls.

Great but fall out of ears.,sierram171,4,2023-09-25,As a mama of 2 littles who is always on the go I love these headphones! They make it so easy to take a call or respond to a text without needing to pick up my phone! The only issue I have with them is they fall out of my ears if I'm sweating or if I look down
,Claudia,5,2023-09-24,I'm very happy with my purchase. The package came all sealed and the quality of the AirPods is amazing
Great product,Erika,4,2023-09-24,First one i ordered did not charge after about a week. Walmart refunded and i ended up purchasing again and my second pair has been working and charging just fine. It's been roughly 3 months now.
Just okay,betsyb39,3,2023-09-23,"They are so small, and fall out of my ears when I run‚Ä¶. Or maybe I just have big ears! I do like the sound quality and how fast they charge but they really are just okay"
Good investment,morgank134,2,2023-09-23,I am actually impressed with the battery life that both the charging case and AirPods have. I do wish that they weren't so easy to lose. I find that find my iPhone doesn't track it as well as other devices. They do stay in the ears and are comfortable though.
,Ashley,3,2023-09-23,"Was disappointed that a pair of headphones that cost $100 doesn't stay charged longer but overall they're decent, each one stays charged for about 2-3 hours while talking on the phone, watching videos or listening to music, possibly a little longer."
Just dumb,Scar,1,2023-09-22,Ain't give my boss my package and just left
short term charging,dennie,3,2023-09-22,"I don't know if it me, but there not what I was expecting."
Great!,marionb59,4,2023-09-22,"Those AirPod are my go to when I go somewhere, I always bring them with me. I feel like it's kinda the basics of what you put in your bag! They work great! I just feel it would be better if we could change music without touching the phone.."
Quality,iwujic,3,2023-09-22,Isn't that loud but perfect enough so that you're neighbors don't hear! One of my go to headphones best for just falling asleep with them on and super cozy
Lasting batterie,jarencyg1,4,2023-09-21,Love my AirPods . Really comfortable on the ear . I carry them with me everywhere I go. Battery last a long time . They don't hurt my ear or fall out easily
Okay,gabriellea51,3,2023-09-21,"This is the lowest rating I've given. I'm not a fan whatsoever! They always fall out of my ears, and my ears are average size, and they take forever to connect to my phone. I've had 3 pairs and all of them act the same! I started using the free wire headphones you get when you get a new iPhone"
I want a refund now this is so stupid,mauri,5,2023-09-21,Ok so I got my order but they were broke and now I just waisted my money.I'm never buying air pods from Walmart

,As,2,2023-09-20,AirPods wouldn't stay charged and was real low
Wouldn't buy again,Colleen,2,2023-09-20,Charge doesn't last long enough.
Easy on the go,saraho259,4,2023-09-20,"These headphones are great as long as you don't lose them, which you will. Also, one of the earphones will likely go out before the other and you won't know why."

"Convenient and Stylish, but Short Lifespan",nia817,3,2023-09-19,"The Apple AirPods are incredibly convenient and fashionable, providing a great audio experience. However, the significant downside is the relatively short lifespan, which may not justify the high cost. If Apple could improve the durability and battery life, these would be near perfect wireless earbuds."
Not a big fan,kairir3,3,2023-09-19,"I have these but don't use them often. They hurt my ears, I don't like how they feel. Plus I feel like I'm always losing them. Sound quality could be better."
"Great product, affordable price.",Jeremy,5,2023-09-19,"Great price for nearly perfect wireless earbuds. They're my favorite headphones I've used and couldn't recommend them more, especially if you have apple products. This is my second pair the first pair lasted me almost five years before one started to die a little too quickly, but I use them daily."

Easy to use,hanahb3,4,2023-09-18,"The AirPods are pretty simple once you get them connected to your device. They connect automatically when case is opened, and the charging is just as simple. The case uses the same charge cord as iPhone."

Very convenient and easy to use,maddya26,4,2023-09-18,"I've had these AirPods for about three years now and they are great! These were my first ever bluetooth headphones and it was easy to see the difference it makes without a cord. You no longer have to be restricted and worried that something will pull on the cord and they will get pulled out of your ear. It's much more convenient, relatively easy to connect, and produces a clear sound. The only thing is, after wearing them for a while they do start to hurt my ears."
Good,alexish307,4,2023-09-17,The sound is great the compact case I love it it makes it easy to pack or hang off my bag. I don't like that it tracts my location. And I don't like that they don't stay in my ears when I do to the gym.
Okay,katieb767,3,2023-09-17,These did not last that long and started to die quickly. When they are new they work well but for the cost they do not last long enough. Wish they would last longer
Good sound quality and great battery life,richardw42,4,2023-09-17,"Noticed they like to turn off randomly, as well working in the field I work in the magnet collect a bunch of steal and it's quite a headache to remove, but this is a personal problem"
Hurt my ears,savannaht42,3,2023-09-16,Not a huge fan of these AirPods as they are super uncomfortable for my ear shape. I much prefer the pro version with interchangeable cushions! They do hold a charge pretty well.

They are great,bettyt34,3,2023-09-15,These are great I listen to mine when I mow the yard or when I'm cleaning my house. I listen to them about everyday. They keep their charge for a long time. Would definitely recommend them
Nice sound quality,mirandajc178,4,2023-09-15,I have these and use them as my backup whenever I don't have my AirPod pros. I still enjoy using these on occasion. The outside sound blocking capabilities aren't as good as the AirPod pros but that is to be expected and I still have no issue using these.
Convenient,shawnieeluv3,4,2023-09-15,Got these as birthday gift for myself a few years ago and they're still holding up (knocks on wood lol)! I love that these automatically connect to my devices although sometimes my phone is finicky with them. The sound quality is great and they fit perfectly in my ears. I also like that they can be used with devices that aren't apple products!
,WalmartCustomer,1,2023-09-15,"because i had to get my air pods on 13th of September but they just canceled my order, no apologies, no further steps weren't sent me, it's realy annoying"
Slim design,colinr16,4,2023-09-15,I like the slim design that allowed for easy use. I was able to take them on the go and not have to worry about having big and bulky headphone to carry around
great gift,jonathan,5,2023-09-15,i bought my girlfriend this as a birthday gift since she does listen to music. And i bought myself one since i do listen to music this is a great gift idea
Not a fan,kaya52,2,2023-09-15,"Don't like these at all. They're easy to lose, though you can use your find my aol to find them, it's not very accurate. They don't fit well in your ears and the sound isn't super great, given the price."
I recommend these.,Shaun,4,2023-09-15,"These are great!! Even though they are not the newest ones, they still preform very well."

Great,josiel45,4,2023-09-15,Easy to connect and use. Spectacular for the price. They are not noise canceling so you can still hear the sounds around you. They charge quickly and fit well in ears. The only drawback is the battery won't last long after a couple month of usage.

Good quality,micah10,3,2023-09-12,They have really good sound and that fit really good in my ears and I dropped them and they didn't brake. They are really lightweight and they fit into my pockets very easily.
,Achilles,1,2023-09-12,This shi scammed me outta 100 dollars an the package aint arrive the day it said it would.
Disappointed,teresa,2,2023-09-12,They lasted a week. Then decided to quit working in one earüôÑgoing to take them back for a replacement pair
Pretty good.,valeriar373,4,2023-09-12,I really like AirPods especially when I'm out doing things or on the go. One thing I don't like about them is that they tend to hurt my ears when I use them for a short amount of time. I would say they are not as comfortable as other earphones I've tried but for the most part they are very good.

Outdated,lisak377,1,2023-09-10,Once the new AirPods launched my pair seemed to not charge and would not be as connectable as they were previously. Had to see other brands since the newer ones costed more and was unable to acquire the updated version

I love how you can even answer a call without touching the phone. I waited , I'm ready to buy now because the came down so much in price . The sound is very good. It beats my 3 other pair of wireless earbuds. The charge seems to last too. I listen to music quite a bit. I'm using them about all day. 7 hrs on %26 off a bit I haven't run out of power."

Charge stays longer,rosnak1,4,2023-09-09,I love it as it is easy and comfortable to wear. It's not expensive. Worth the cost. The best thing is it's charge stays longer. My husband listens to audiobook at night and still the charge stays good.
Don't stay in all that welk,shannonw124,4,2023-09-09,I loved them until I lost one because they don't fit everyone the same the sound was good but that's it I don't like hr e diagnosis or the fact if I so much as trie Sri adjust them it stopped or muted
There ok,stephanieg720,4,2023-09-09,I like that you do not need an app to use these but sometimes you cannot use them on certain products like chrome books and I did not know that and I did not like that I do like that they charge fast and that you can use them for why I was communication. Also it works well with Siri and other Apple products they are not quite as water resistant as I'd like 11 not very comfortable or you would think that they can make them a little more comfortable so they stay in our ears better. ÔøºÔøº
"Great item, smooth transaction",Kim,5,2023-09-09,The item was new and works perfect. The transaction was smooth. I'm happy with the functionality of the AirPods.

Great value,haileyd122,4,2023-09-09,Even it is my fourth AirPod but i still continue to use it. Because it is essential to my daily life can't live without it. It's kinda weird because the more you use it the faster it will break
,WalmartCustomer,5,2023-09-08,The airpods and the case was a birthday gift for my 14 yr old daughter and she loves it. I just love that Walmart has everything I need when I need it.
Great for travel,anitas115,3,2023-09-08,I like using my AirPods when I'm traveling through an airport or on a plane. They do not take up a lot of space. They are also light and can fit into any type off travelers bag.
Good,valentinab249,3,2023-09-08,"I liked these headphones a lot when they were working properly, the first 8 months or so they worked amazing but once the year & a half mark came I needed to buy new ones because they werent always working."
Amazing,lewis,5,2023-09-08,They sound amazing definitely worth it you should get a case that covers the opening so if you drop them they will not fall out of the case
Love em!,V,5,2023-09-08,"I love em ‚ô•Ô∏è I've used the newer ones w the ear thingy cushion , I don't like those. I feel they get dirty quicker. These feel less irritating in my ears than the newer ones. They're perfect."
classic and stay in better than the pros,kiaras83,4,2023-09-08,"i really enjoyed these when i had them. i do think they can be less comfortable than the pros, but they definitely stay in my ears better, and they get the job done."
Convenient quality sound.,cherm4,4,2023-09-07,"I like to use my Apple air pods in a variety of situations. Traveling, listening to podcasts, music and conversations. They are compact, easy to use and have great sound quality. They keep you updated on battery life of case and pods, which is convenient. My only complaint would be the fit of the pods in my ears. They fall out and become very uncomfortable after putting them back in so often."
,Ebonee,4,2023-09-07,Everything works except the charger
,Mela,2,2023-09-07,I bought it for a gift and the right hearing aid doesn't work. what can i do to solve the problem?
One of the best Apple products!,taylors626,4,2023-09-07,"I love my AirPods! They are so light and easy to use because you don't have to worry about the wires getting all tangled! When I first bought mine, I couldn't use them on airplanes because you had to have regular earbuds, but now they make adapters so you can use them! They also can get uncomfortable in your ears after hours of use at a time so I usually like to switch between the left and right!"
Above average,johnlukep,4,2023-09-07,"Not sure if these are the old or new ones but the new ones are much better, they feature noice cancellation which works very well for ear buds. I would recommend."

Grass isn't always greener,susan,5,2023-09-06,"Had them before my dog ate them. So I got them again. Purchased the AirPods Pro but they cut my ears so went back to these and I love them. They fit good, sound good."

Would recommend,kyleep28,4,2023-09-06,I mainly use my AirPods when I am working out at the gym. I like that they don't have a cord and are easy to use. They don't fall out of my ears and the sound is pretty decent.
,WalmartCustomer,1,2023-09-06,Had to cancel my order.

I done had 4 pairs,devonm36,3,2023-09-05,Maybe I'm irresponsible but I've had 4 pairs of AirPods I've lost them but i can say I've washed plenty and they still worked for the most part i just wish i could find them while they are dead
Highly recommend!,Jessica,5,2023-09-05,I LOVE these! The battery life it great and it takes days before I get the notification that they need to be charged.
NOT WORTH IT,jadenb31,1,2023-09-05,I mainly used these when I was at the gym or doing cardio. They were uncomfortable in my ears and always gave me headaches. Don't get my started on the ear wax that gets stuck inside. The charge never lasts and it's so annoying when one bud dies before the other. Spend $$ somewhere else.
,Ismael,1,2023-09-05,there is an issue with both the earphones the right one won't charge and the left one says it's connected to a whole different airpod
Good,Jonathan,4,2023-09-05,I like them but I lost them and I have warranty and I need new ones
,Javier,2,2023-09-05,"If the item isn't available at the store, the website shouldn't say ""available for pickup"". Not any of the employee's fault but very misleading and inconvenient. Now I also have to wait 3-5 days for my money back."
Fake airpods,Elisa,1,2023-09-05,"I bought these less than a year ago and they broke almost immediately after I got them. I finally took them to the apple store to get them checked out and they told me they were fake. Sure enough, the serial number isnt legit and they are heavier than normal airpods."

"Work well, comfortability was an issue.",chelseaa123,4,2023-09-04,"The air pods were great as far as sound goes, but they fit uncomfortably in my ears and I couldn't wear for longer than 15 min. This could vary by person, I gave them to my son & he loves them!"
Airpods,lilam85,4,2023-09-04,I love my air pods and how convenient they are. The only downside is when I wear them to the gym I can hear some background noise. But I still use them because of how convenient they are.
,WalmartCustomer,5,2023-09-04,"The product is a decent Apple product, but the price is ok given it's a second generation and should be a bit cheaper."

,WalmartCustomer,5,2023-09-03,Ordered the same this past Christmas and they were great but unfortunately my daughter lost them so I needed to purchase another pair and got a good sale
"Useful, but breaks often",jessicat334,4,2023-09-03,"I've had three apple air pods, and they've either stopped working on one side, the mic has stopped working, or I've lost one. I wish they were able to be used with others and synced up, but you're stuck buying another pair. When they work, their absolutely amazing, hence why I keep replacing them, but it's getting EXPENSIVE."
Not really a fan,blueeve,3,2023-09-03,"Not really a fan of these pods. There is nothing wrong with the sound, they are just too long and dont fit my ears. Samsung buds are a much better fit for me."

Positive,Bonnie,5,2023-09-03,"I have wanted a pair of these for a very, very long time. My daughter finally got me a pair for my birthday this year and I absolutely love them. I always have one in my ear at all times it makes talking on a song listening to music everything so much easier and better the quality of hearing has increased, but you would not believe."

AirPods 2nd Gen,Angela,5,2023-09-03,I'm loving all things Apple right now. All the bells %26 whistles that Apple presents with their products just makes me giddy! These 2nd Generation AirPods are great. I love that Walmart had a price I could stand plus a Protection Plan for 2yrs made this purchase AWESOME!

,laura,4,2023-09-02,Good quality and sound. My only issue is that I have small ear canals and they are a tight fit. It would be great if Apple made different sizes to accommodate smaller ears
Great AirPods,breannat51,4,2023-09-02,"I have a total of 5 different AirPods that I just keep around and these are my favorite! I workout almost everyday, I jump, run, and do all these different movements and they won't fall out the ear. They are also very comfortable."
Disappointed,Maryellen,1,2023-09-02,They don't work so I have to return them
Great earphones,jacquelinet4453,4,2023-09-02,"I've been using these for some time now and they're very useful earphones. Some of the cons I'd say is that I wish the battery life is longer, and if it would actually notify you when the charging case is low. The earphones are not bad but does start to hurt my ears once in a while. Also when I only use one earphone, the caller on the other end seems to have issues hearing me. Other than that they're great for playing music."

Great purchase!!!!,Meia,5,2023-09-02,"Received my order the very best day! Packaging was a awesome! And I am in LOVE with them! They don't fall out of my ears, which was my biggest fear! They easily connected with my phone, sound quality is great! And I absolutely love that I am able to see the battery life on them individually. Also the price was awesome! I save quite a bit considering how much they were everywhere else!"

Good,karinc21,4,2023-09-01,"I personally love using my AirPods, but I'm one who misplaces things on accident, so my husband is always helping me find my airpod case lol‚Ä¶ that's the only bad thing about them, that they're so easy to lose, and there's no way of tracking them in a room with my iPhone, it'd be nice if Apple did something like that."
Good sound quality,felicityk13,4,2023-09-01,I have a really bad problem with washing my AirPods but after several accidental washes they still work great and I've had them for 5 years now and they still hold up

They're alright,yasemina12,3,2023-09-01,"I love how they're wireless but if I'm being honest they always break so easily. The earbuds always go out especially if your sweating while working out. Also my ear holes are really small so they never fit properly, pop off, and sometimes hurt"
"Great, but big",dailynnb1,4,2023-09-01,"I love Apple products, air pods being one of them. They connect really easily, charge fast, and easy to carry around. You really can't knock it, besides it being a little big in for my ears. I have smaller ears and if I leave them in for a prolonged time my ears will hurt a little bit. Other than that no complaints."

Worth the hype,ananyab81aa,4,2023-08-31,"These tiny little things are a game changer! So nifty and you can slip them into your pocket, purse, or bookbag. I would say the size is also its downfall where you can easily loose track of where they are."
Expensive for what it is,garretty1,3,2023-08-31,"I'm an Apple lover, I got these as a Christmas gift one year. They started out great as most apple products do. But of course as the years went on the sound quality got worse, the charging was on and off where only one earbud would charge. And then the fact that they collect so much grime and dust is just kind of gross."
They get job done,Emily,3,2023-08-31,I only got another pair because I lost mine :/ these pair work fine but the battery life is drastically worse than my older pair.

If you can wait for a Black Friday or back to school sale, you'll feel even better about the price. The sound is good enough for me and I mostly use it to listen to podcasts. A big con about these AirPods is that my mic stopped working exactly one year after purchase. I was just past the warranty. My advice: get the AppleCare."

Good but bad life span,madalynl9,4,2023-08-29,I loved these AirPods but they didn't last very long. After about 6 months my left airpod stopped working and they stopped charging but overall a nice alternative for more expensive wireless headphones.

Solid noise canceling,melaniec172,4,2023-08-29,"I bought these for air travel because that plane droning noise drives me a little crazy, and I had a 6 hour flight coming up. I wore them on the bus to the airport as well as in the air, and they did a great job dimming the noise of both without completely blocking out outside sound (so if someone spoke to me, I could still hear it, just more faintly). The sound quality is good and I was able to watch a show on the plane without having to crank the sound up really high, which I appreciate (and I didn't even really need subtitles, which is HUGE for air travel for me!) I did find that my ears got a bit tired of wearing them, but again this was a 6 hour flight and so even with a few breaks, it was a long stretch of having earbuds in."
,WalmartCustomer,5,2023-08-28,Because the Airpods don't last long so I will have to buy another pair. This is the 3rd pair i've bought.

Great Purchase!!,Contessa,5,2023-08-26,I bought these for my daughter. She loves them. I purchased the air pods online and picked them. It was a seamless purchase!!
Look great and is comfortable to wear.,jenn68,4,2023-08-26,This is the first part of the wireless earbuds I own. And I think there great. They came with their own charging unit and cable.

The unit came well-packed and in a timely manner.

"Good connection, good sound",ann46,4,2023-08-25,"When watching movies or playing games on Apple home devices, it doesn't seem to feel the connection delay of the device. This 2nd generation headphone from Apple really did a good job of quick connectivity in the ecosystem. Friendly sound quality, with a little more bass than other devices in the same segment The midrange will be greatly enhanced, the vocals pass through extremely clearly. Voice calls are the best talking headphone."
one issue..,sanadan,3,2023-08-25,"Sound good compared to 2nd gen. The bass is a bit more noticeable and didn't really notice too much with the head tracking feature. However, the only gripe I have with is is the case! Users beware! If you drop, dangle, or even shake these hard enough they WILL fall out! Almost lost one but luckily my friend found found it in the parking lot. If anything, your better buying a case with some sort of clip or buckle."

The convenience of being able to connect them to my iPhone effortlessly is fantastic. I no longer have to deal with tangled wires or struggling to find the right adapter. The audio quality is outstanding, providing a crisp and immersive sound experience. Plus, the battery life is impressive, allowing me to enjoy my favorite music and podcasts for hours on end. Overall, I couldn't be happier with my AirPods and I highly recommend them to anyone in need of a reliable and top-notch wireless earphone solution."
So much better than wires,emmaliek,4,2023-08-24,I love th√®se AirPods but my only problem is that they don't sound as good as air pod pros. I love th√®se they stay in my ear well and no wires which I love for when I'm laying down or exercise
Amazing,Esther,5,2023-08-24,"I love AirPods so much! They fit comfortably in my ears and the sound quality is so good. They can get lost easily and the sound can sometimes bleed out, but other than that I have absolutely no complaints."

The one left after charging will be changed and used (if necessary)"
,WalmartCustomer,5,2023-08-23,I was standing inside of Meijer electronics looking 4 airpods. Daughter birthday gift. They were looking in the back and I was on Walmart website ordering for cheaper and they were at the house the next day perfect timing
Always not easy to keep up with‚Ä¶,janiyar5,4,2023-08-23,"One of the AirPods tend to go missing under my bed sometimes while listening to music and I have to dig all underneath my bed just to find it. But nevertheless, the quality's is still good!"

expensive for what they are,refriedbeans,3,2023-08-23,"The Bluetooth functionality of these works great, but I would recommend looking elsewhere for wireless headphones. These don't fit in my ears well and are therefore uncomfortable, and there's no way to adjust the size."
,Lisa,4,2023-08-22,They sounds really good and they work great so far. Just bought a case for them.
Great headphones,nicoleschu13,4,2023-08-22,"I have had these headphones for about a year and I loveee them. They charge up very quickly and love the short cuts. The only downside to them is after a year of use, the volume is not where it used to be. I have to listen to it at full volume to hear music. Maybe this is what happened with the headphones aging, but I would buy again."

Great,rinaw2,4,2023-08-21,I love these headphones because they're so easy to use and you can store them very easily since they are so small. The case is really cool because you can charge your AirPods without having a charging cord with you at all times. I use these all the time in the sound quality is amazing.
Low battery life,Mac,4,2023-08-21,The charge doesnt last very long but for the price not bad
Good headphones,brookew146,4,2023-08-21,"Good headphones! I have a hard time using in ear earbuds as they don't stay in my ears, so this shape of earbud is perfect. The sound is good and they charge very fast."

Airpod,tiffanyn153,4,2023-08-20,I have been using this Airpod for 3-4 years until I got a new one - Airpod Pro. It is small and cute size. I like the Pro more just because of the noise canceling
100-percent Apple and better price with Walmart,Watergirl,5,2023-08-20,Great product. My old ones weren't charging well so I had to purchase a new pair. Same model. Love them!!
Just ok!,lillyn28,3,2023-08-20,"Bought 1 pair for my daughter. First she very enjoyed, and later she complain not stay in her ears very well. After 1 years the AirPod stopped working. Maybe something wrong with my items. ButI still love all products from Apple."

Very good,naomih105,4,2023-08-20,I love these AirPods so much and I use them every single day but after about two years they stopped working as well and they sound quality is quiet and one airpod is quieter than the other. I have to listen on full volume to hear it perfectly.

"Comfortable, convenient charging on the go",samanthag554,4,2023-08-19,"After many years of sticking with the traditional iPhone headphones, I finally made the switch to AirPods. All of the concerns about misplacing these were never actually a problem. Instead they're super convenient, charge quickly in the case on the go, are great for travel (no more knots and tangles). Just make sure to clean the buds regularly especially if you wear them while exercising etc."
Good,parthp9,4,2023-08-19,"It's a good product for sure. Stays in your ears without discomfort with good audio quality. However, battery does run out in few hours when wearing. Would prefer if it lasted longer"

don't drop them,apann,3,2023-08-19,"i'm a very clumsy person and tend to drop my airpods very frequently. i find that when i drop my airpods, it shatters the microphone or something because my volume is very low on facetime for the receiving party. no amount of rice will fix my microphone"
Nice first Apple airpods,phuongp16,4,2023-08-19,This was my first Apple Airpods. I bought it because it was very convenient that I could wear everywhere without being annoyed by the wire. The sound quality was ok. One thing I didn't like was the body of the airpods were a bit long. It easily felt out if I didn't pay attention. It was acceptable because it was the first Apple wireless earphones.
Volume,joidiayad,3,2023-08-19,Of course most apple products are amazing. I have had about 3 pair do to the fact overtime one of the ear buds become very faint but over all I would recommend.
Stays in small ear canals!,rachellll,4,2023-08-18,I bought these with the expectation that they would not be used for exercise as I thought they would fall out. I was wrong! These stay in! They have good sound quality as well! I do wish they would turn up a little louder as I like my music deafeningly loud but that's ok.
,Cynthia,5,2023-08-18,These are a gift for my grandson His dad says he will like them They were on sale and I have seen them for a lot more money He just got an I phone The music will sound great coming from his phone

Essential,ashleyh1188,4,2023-08-17,"I love my AirPods, i use them almost daily. The only downside is the time it takes to fully charge them again, but other than that they're confortable and produce great sound"
AirNots,bearsandtacos,2,2023-08-17,I have a pair of Apple AirPods and they were not comfortable or very fitting to my ears. They always fallout and I'm scared I'm gonna lose them when working out. I had to buy adapters plus to fit and stay in my ear. They're very pricey for something I can't use as it was intended for. For the price I do t recommend I would go with something else or at least try them before buying. On a good note the sound was great. I had no issues with my music or phone calls. They paired with my laptop too so I was able to join meetings and use my AirPods.
Awesome,isabellm9,4,2023-08-17,"My original airpod case just stopped charging out of nowhere. Turns out its a very typical issue to happen. Im not spending another 100 for a new airpod case or airpods in general. These are a great, cheap replacement. They are the same size as my originals. Everything is relatively the same."

However, when I got these, the music was another level! I can't explain it. It was as if I was front n center of a private concert in a small room. It is amazing! I would, however, not pay more than what I did. I'm glad I got a bargain with the sale price."

Not Only For The Young At Heart,DB,5,2023-08-07,These were a gift for someone that's never had wireless earbuds before. (The 50 generation) She loved the sound quality and listens to music all day through her AirPods now. I thought it might be hard for her to answer calls but she's learned everything quite quickly. I bought these on sale which was also a plus.
,WalmartCustomer,4,2023-08-07,The Pods are in good condition and the price was standard - they had some issues charging at first but i think that was a minor glitch.
,Sheri,3,2023-08-06,See they were good at first but then they keeping doing this thing where it just stops playing the music all of a sudden. The crazy part about it is the fact the music is playing but sound won't come out.

,WalmartCustomer,5,2023-07-19,"I got a good deal with the back to school discounts, those airpods go for about $120 or more everywhere else."
,WalmartCustomer,3,2023-07-19,"The right airpod does not stay in my ear, but the left one does. Physical bodies are different so its challenging to make a one size fits all."
good but the sound could be better,Arielle,3,2023-07-18,the sound would go in and out of the airpods at time
,Katina,1,2023-07-18,They were not authentic airpods! I am very disappointed!
alright,N,2,2023-07-18,they worked well but i think this gen of airpods always get really quiet after a while. ive had two pair plus everybody ive known with them have also experienced it
,WalmartCustomer,5,2023-07-18,I've always been iffy as if I wanted to purchase them but they are a great product with great sound quality and definitely were worth what I paid for them!

10/10,Victoria,5,2023-07-17,I love how noise canceling they can be. Siri picks up good when I need to change a song. The battery life is amazing still. I've had these for 3 years and they work like I just bought them.

Great sound and long battery life.,taylork202,4,2023-07-17,I love my airpods. This is the second version i've purchased! They're great for listening to music and blocking the world out. I also love that they will read texts and other notifications out loud while on the go.

Online ordering was quick and easy. Shipping was free and I received the Airpods the same day I ordered them."
Worth it!,Emily,5,2023-07-13,"I thought other brands would be similar quality, but nothing really compares to these Apple Air Pods. Crisp, clean sound and long lasting battery!"
,sandy,1,2023-07-12,"wrong description was first generation, not second generation as advertised"
AirPods,Esther,5,2023-07-12,Wish they were louder. But otherwise they are great. When someone is calling it notifies you that someone is calling and you have to options to say yes or no to answer the call. Love them

Store would not let me return them,Alyssa,1,2023-07-06,Purchased AirPods and the right side didn't work and the light would blink. I tried to return them the next day to my store and they wouldn't take them because all the serial numbers didn't match the one on the box. The serial number on the case is the only one that matches the box. The 2nd generation AirPods have different serial number all three pieces. I tried to explain this to the lady and she would not take them back.

They took my money,terrance,1,2023-07-02,I can't use them I tried to pair them with my phone and they say it's stolen I brought regular air pods and not air pods pro what's going on
Great airpods,Joni,5,2023-07-02,These work great. Had one pair and they worked great but spouse decided he needed a set of his own. We now have two sets and both are used often.
"Cool , fits, works",samp103,4,2023-07-02,"Airpods are good for daily use. I use them for my office calls and also personal entertainment. There is risk of falling and losing them, but with care there are nice. Used both as Samsung galaxy, iphone, mac and Windows lapy user"

Good Soind Quality,kscholl,4,2023-06-30,good sound quality and the battery last for a a very long time! I like that they are not noise canceling so k can still hear when I have them in if someone wants to speak with me
Great!,dominickr5,4,2023-06-30,"The AirPods are good earphones. They make it very easy when you want to use them which Bluetooth connects automatically with your headphones and phone. I would say the other downside of these are that they tend to hurt the inside of your ear when used a long period of time. Other than that, i would recommend these."

Should have purchased sooner!,carrie,5,2023-06-30,I love the fit of the AirPod in my ear which I was worried about because I have smaller ears. Charge lasts forever and I'm so glad I finally bought them! Walmart made it easy and delivered the same day of purchase! If you've been wondering; DO IT!

Good but not great,samanthas995,4,2023-06-27,I love these because of the compact design. the only problem i've had is that they sometimes fall out of my ears. I prefer the old cord ear pods when i'm traveling so i don't loose an airpod!
Good headphones,olgad25,4,2023-06-27,Good wireless headphones however having problems with people hearing me during phone calls. Otherwise great sound quality and charge quickly
Like them,ashleys937,4,2023-06-27,These little guys fit fairly well in my ears. I can run with them not falling out. In order to hear someone talking I usually have to take one out! I'd recommend them to anyone looking
"Quality, Comfort, Easy",jasonjgill,4,2023-06-27,I use my Apple AirPods daily and they are the most comfortable pair of in ear headphones I have ever owned. The charge is long lasting and the AirPods easily connect to all of my devices.

Great case,pnae,4,2023-06-25,The case to charge the AirPods are great! Very compact and easy to charge. I like that there are multiple options for cases when it comes to protecting the actual case. If worse comes to worse and I'm ever in need. I'd buy a case again.
Happy purchase,Chetan,4,2023-06-25,overall I am happy with the product regarding price and quality. not happy with the long term use as it becomes uncomfortable and sometimes not bearable.

Convenient,kumarip3,3,2023-06-24,These are my go to headphones! I love how convenient they are but I wish they weren't so hard to lose. This is my third pair. My first pair of headphones had issues with the charging port so they died on me very quickly.

"Nice, but big and get dirty easily",magdalenay1,4,2023-06-23,"I loved my airpods. They were a bit too big for my ears, but ideal for everything in my life like working out, listening to school lectures, or listening to music."
Good value,amandaa564,3,2023-06-23,"Audio quality isn't as great as newer versions but they get the job done, especially when you compare cost. I have newer pairs and I still reach for the OG Apple AirPods."
"Great Sound, but not the Best Fit",m1la444,4,2023-06-22,"The Apple AirPods are an excellent choice for anyone looking for high-quality wireless earbuds. The sound quality is fantastic, and the connectivity is seamless. I have been using these earbuds for a while, and I must say, I am impressed with the sound quality. The bass is deep, and the treble is crisp, making it perfect for all kinds of music. However, I did encounter an issue with the fit. They do not fit my ears perfectly, which make them a bit uncomfortable, especially during extended use. But, this is a personal issue, and it may not be the case for everyone. Overall, I would recommend the Apple AirPods to anyone looking for high-quality wireless earbuds. They have great sound quality, and the connectivity is seamless. However, if you are someone who is sensitive to fit issues, you may want to try them out before purchasing."
Awesome!,Dakota,4,2023-06-22,Work wonderful just uncomfortable to wear for long periods of time.

"Very good, I would recommend this product!",Kimberly,3,2023-06-20,"I think it doesn't matter if it's a high-end product or not. The Apple earbuds shorted out after a couple of months‚Ä¶even though they're wireless. Kind of disappointing for the price. So, I always get a warranty!"
Their Pretty basic,kamilaf15,3,2023-06-19,"Their Pretty basic, like your normal wireless headphones. Mine are pretty old so they don't really have good range, if yours were newer they might have better range but idk"
Overall good with room for improvement,svenp6,4,2023-06-19,"The Apple AirPods are undeniably a game-changer when it comes to wireless earbuds. With their sleek design, ease of use, and impressive sound quality, they have certainly earned their reputation. I would confidently give them a solid 4-star rating. One of the standout features of the AirPods is their seamless connectivity with Apple devices. The pairing process is effortless, and once connected, they provide a reliable wireless experience. The audio quality is excellent, delivering crisp and clear sound across various genres of music and podcasts. The convenience factor cannot be overstated. The AirPods' lightweight design and the absence of tangled wires make them incredibly portable. They are perfect for those on the go, whether you're commuting, working out, or simply enjoying your favorite content. The integration with Siri is a handy addition. The ability to control music playback, make calls, and access information through voice commands adds an extra layer of convenience to the AirPods experience. However, there are a few areas where Apple could consider improvements. Firstly, the fit may not be ideal for everyone. While the majority of users find the AirPods comfortable, some individuals may experience a looser fit, especially during vigorous activities. Offering different ear tip sizes or customizable fit options could address this concern. Additionally, the active noise cancellation capability, while decent, could be further enhanced. While the AirPods do a reasonable job of reducing background noise, there is room for improvement to match the noise-canceling prowess of some dedicated over-ear headphones. Lastly, the battery life, while adequate for most daily use, could benefit from some improvement. Extending the playback time on a single charge would be welcomed, especially for those who use their AirPods extensively throughout the day. Despite these minor areas for improvement, the Apple AirPods remain an exceptional choice for wireless earbuds. Their seamless connectivity, impressive audio quality, and unmatched convenience make them a top contender in the market. With a few tweaks, they have the potential to reach an even higher level of excellence."
Airpods Gen 3,satyae,3,2023-06-18,"They do the job, but I wish I bought a different model. The 3rd Gen fall out of my ears, which is not an issue I ever had with the 1st Gen. Sound quality is ok, but I don't think I could wear these to run or anything because they fall out so easily."

it's fine,emyrinac,3,2023-06-16,it's really good headphones but one does die faster and after using it for a while the battery gets weaker. you would definitely need to upgrade to the next gen.

Works great for the most part,yasminc74,4,2023-06-15,I give this a 4 because they worked great at first but after a year they started to get quieter and quieter. I do recommend if needing reliable headphones for a first time user'
,Sabrina,5,2023-06-15,"These work great with my iPhone! This is my second pair, as with my first pair the R AirPod stopped working after just over 4 years of having them, which I think is a long while to last.

Overall it's a great product,Evelina,4,2023-06-14,The sound quality is great and I was surprised how well they stay in my ears even without the rubber pieces like some ear buds have. They are also pretty comfortable when wearing for a long period of time. I would definitely recommend but I don't know if I could say they are worth the price
Good purchase,Jonathan,4,2023-06-13,I liked them brand new my package did get delayed but other than that it was a good purchase I recommend buying them
Airpods,cassies140,4,2023-06-13,I love how long the battery life is on these ear buds. The case holds a charge as well to add to the life of these. They are easy to connect to my phone and automatically connect when I put them in my ears. They are a bit uncomfortable after wearing them for some time but that's the only downfall I have encounters thus far.

Super cute and light,minao7,4,2023-06-11,"Only con is, depending on your ear shape these may fall out. That was my friends issue but mine fit fine. Sounds great too! Not a lot of bass but you can't get that with Tiny phones like this."

convenient!,jenl84,4,2023-06-11,wireless airpods save my day because i always have to play music while doing something. it's easier without the cords getting in the way. a con would be that it might die a bit faster after some time
convenient,kamerynb6,4,2023-06-10,"i carry them with me everywhere. convenient to wear and aren't as obvious as my airpod max. they have crapped out over the past few years where i have to wear them in the opposite ear, making me want the max."
They get lost easily,milianisc,4,2023-06-10,I love how loud they are And how you know where they are if you loose them bc they got a tracker I recomend these but also I don't because you could get better ones
Not my favorite,bridgettem25,4,2023-06-10,These are not my favorite they don't hold a good charge and they are so easy to lose The air pods themselves are good with sound but that about all I like from them

Great Sound but quality is lacking,karenh326,4,2023-06-08,"I have been using these headphones for about two years now. They have great sound and are reasonably comfortable to wear for extended periods. However, in the last couple of months the sound quality has significantly diminished in the right earpiece so I can barely hear anything. Another thing I have also noticed is they now make a random crackling sound and have issues connecting. The same thing happened with two of my family members. I would expect for the $ spent they would last longer than 2 years."

Crispy Clearsound,bluenile,3,2023-06-07,"I love these AirPods, but it's definitely not worth the price. They are some better ones out there. The only thing I hate about them is that you have such a hard time having him stay inside of your ear, no matter which. Rubber piece I choose. It still falls out of my ears. I bought two in a matter of three months, but I decided I'm not gonna buy it anymore."
,CameRon,1,2023-06-06,"AirPods worked for 2 days , after the 2 days left AirPod quit working and wouldn't connect to iPhone. Just got to Apple ):"

good,alinah73,4,2023-06-05,"Really nice Product and really nice do you don't wanna listen to music at the gym or at school It's one of my favorite products in the message and it's way easier and since they're wireless, it makes things so much easier to move around"
Air pods,myra,3,2023-06-05,After 6 months the buds don't work anymore
fall out of ear,sharikah1,4,2023-06-05,these are good wireless earbuds but nothing too extrodinary. i have an apple iphone so it easily paired with my phone which i liked. the shape isn't the best for me so it fell out of my ear especially when working out.
,leslie,1,2023-06-05,after 5 month only one of them is note working.
Used not working,Ahmad,1,2023-06-04,It's used and it's not working
Airpods,nataliev81,4,2023-06-04,i like any airpods from apple i haven't had any problems with them. idk about the rest but 2nd generation leaks once you hit the 6-7 tap on volume but i mean most headphones do leak but yeah they're cheap and good to use

Horrible,Maritza,1,2023-06-02,Bought them on April and one stopped working already.
Horrible,Maritza,1,2023-06-02,Bought them on April and one stopped working already.
Could use improvements,hasanii,3,2023-06-01,"Great headphones but they seem to run out of battery life quiet fast after a couple of months. They charge fast however which is a bonus, I just feel like that battery life could use a few improvements in the future."
Meh,stayc333,3,2023-06-01,These are mediocre at best. They're a wireless option if that's what you're looking for but I don't think they're the most comfortable option on the market.
Dies quick,abirm10,3,2023-05-30,"Airpods 1 does an amazing job with its charge in the first couple months, maybe a year. But after that the charge dies within 40 mins of use. I barely get 30-40 mins out of the pair I have. I have bought it more than 2 years ago so this performance is quite understandable."
Actual earbuds don't fit in ear comfortably after,lissyn1,3,2023-05-30,"Have had them for about 4 years, needing to update as I've tried newer generations and they ‚Äòhug' you ears more comfortably. Ears become sore after a while of continuous use."
Great sound bad battery,justyna_k,4,2023-05-29,I love all apple products and always can't wait to get my hands on the new ones . I've had these for a few years now and feel like I can give a full review . I love how small and compact they are . They are comfortable in my ears but I do worry that too much motion might knock them out . The battery on the other hand is not the best . They die very quickly on me. I try to keep one ear at a time on so that I can switch it out with a fully charged one . The case holds a charge for a while though which is good !
Works for a while,chloel298,4,2023-05-27,"I think they are worth the investment, but the one thing I hate is how much I lose them. Also one of my airpods stopped working for no reason, which is annoying."
Great for on the go!!!!,brandyh136,4,2023-05-27,These airpods are great if you're on the go and need free hands and very comfortable while wearing these. They have great sound and are very clear while listening to your music I would definitely recommend getting some .

Not as great.,ashtronauuts,3,2023-05-26,"First gen is old and not great to use. Very easy to break and sensitive and doesn't really have great volume. If you're going to buy AirPods, please buy the Pros instead."

,Demitrius,5,2023-05-25,"They good if you keep taking care of them, I would recommend using them with a iPhone. You get the most out of them then a android."
Quality,ericas178,4,2023-05-25,I've had my AirPods for about 5 years now and I do love them but they did start messing up after a while. Wether it was the AirPods were not in the case even though they were they sometimes don't charge. Overall for the time I've had them I'm impressed and the noise cancellation is not bad!
Vary good on the headphones,jeromej3,4,2023-05-25,Works well for me when I'm at the gym working out. I really suggest the wireless charger with these. There easy to loose so keep them somewhere close. Overall good product.
"Great quality, good sound",alexandrap277,4,2023-05-25,I was hesitant to buy apple AirPods for years & I finally caved & I do NOT regret my decision. I love them I use them everyday! I love getting to talk to people without have my phone up to my ear. 9/10!!

Pretty good!!,eduardav9,4,2023-05-24,"I've had these for a WHILE! and really really liked them, just over the years of course they started to act weird. One side was charging more than the other but apart from that it was good"
Easy to get dirty inside box,dinhd2,4,2023-05-24,I have one in second day they started sell out at store. I buy with all my expect. That true they fit all my need easy to use. Easy to set up but have 1 minus is easy to get dirty inside
Great price and quality!!,Isaac,5,2023-05-24,Really like how these are holding up. I thought it wouldn't be as good but it turns out they have great sound quality and they stay on when I skate so that's a plus!

Good but could be so much better,samanthall1,3,2023-05-23,"I've purchased two pairs and have had problems with them disconnecting or not being able to connect at all sometimes. The sound is good and I like the charging case but I wish they were more durable. I've also experienced not being able to use the find my app to locate them when I misplace them on either pair , it won't show me the location or play the sound until after I've already found them."
,Faten,1,2023-05-23,The product did not work at all.
,WalmartCustomer,5,2023-05-23,There was nothing wrong with my product I received what I wanted in a timely fashion and will order again
Love airpods,mckenziem6,4,2023-05-23,"AirPods are just so nice to heave because when I go to the gym I don't need a cord all around me when I'm working out. Super reliable, charges fast and is honestly one of my favorite Apple devices"
,Faten,1,2023-05-23,The product did not work at all.
Practical AirPods,dianas541,4,2023-05-23,"These are a very good pair of practical AirPods for on the go, work, school. The batter doesn't last too long and when I use these in the gym they don't stick to my ears. Maybe the new generations are better and improved but I don't have an experience to share yet."
Sound muted after a while,jacobh50,3,2023-05-23,After owning for over 6 months the left pod started to not play music. I routinely clean them and take care of them as instructed. I still love them but quality could be better.
Great audio quality!,angeaz,4,2023-05-22,"I love the apple AirPods! I currently only have the first generation, and it works decently. I use it everyday. It is super portable, accessible, and easy to use! The audio quality is amazing and it makes traveling so much easier. However, the AirPods are a little uncomfortable to wear after a long period of using them, but that is just my personal experience."
Apple AirPods,wardahk1,3,2023-05-22,Honestly not my favorite apple AirPods . They worked great at first but after a year they just didn't hit the same . I prefer the AirPods Pro's from apple.
To the point,christina,1,2023-05-21,"Hate them, they hurt my ears, and kept falling out of my ears."
Sound quality is very good.,lisap414,4,2023-05-21,I like to use my AirPods while driving because it's hands free and I only use one at a time. I also like it while traveling because it can tune out another's music choice or conversation if you don't want to hear.
,Juana,3,2023-05-21,You have to raise the volume very high to be able to hear anything your listening to
Very convenient,hannahh539,4,2023-05-21,Love these compared to wired headphones. I've had mine for 5 years and they still work great. The battery lasts a long time and they are very convenient to use while cleaning the house or on walks since you don't have to be attached to your phone while using.
"Good, would recommend.",blackout,4,2023-05-21,"Nothing to be really said, they do what they are supposed to and they aren't defective."
Like but not love,Niesha,4,2023-05-21,I love the convenience of the AirPod's but this model does not have the noise cancellation so I will definitely upgrade soon
Be careful with these!,elizabethj207,3,2023-05-21,I used to love apple products. I bought an iphone and these airpods. I was disappointed. I had connectivity problems when i tried to pair them to my phone. These were not worth what i paid for them.
Wish they were size adjustable,erinm467,3,2023-05-21,Apple AirPods are decent Bluetooth earbuds but I would prefer to have silicon tips because my ears are small and sometimes they fall out of my ears.
I like them but I also don't ‚Ä¶,annp55,3,2023-05-20,"I enjoy these, don't get me wrong, but I don't feel comfortable using them in all situations. I can take a walk and use them, or use them sitting at my desk. I've worn them at the gym and they've literally fallen out of my ears into a trash can. I've worn them while being otherwise active and they've also fallen out of my ears. One wrong shoulder move and they fall out."
Great audio,samaia,3,2023-05-20,"I would love these even more if they would just fit into my ear. Constantly they keep falling out and makes listening to music unpleasant. Otherwise, the sound and overall idea of these earbuds are great."

Great sound,michaelw131,3,2023-05-19,Has very clear sound. Fantastic bass and treble. Charges super fast. Small compact design. Easy to accessorize. Definitely worth the price..
Small and Convenient,lisag403,3,2023-05-19,These headphones are not bad they are very convenient and small good for travel but they are not my favorite they do start hurting my ears after a while of use and the battery life seemed to drain pretty quickly after I had them for a month the sound seemed to lower and poor it didn't seem as good as when I first bought them.
Great overall,biancaa145,4,2023-05-19,"I've had this same pair for 4 years now, they have been through the washing machine/dryer twice and STILL work and have great sound quality. My only complaint is how easily they slide out of your ear when doing physical activity, if any sort of sweat goes near them they fall out which is unfortunate. I love the fact that their easy to clean with q-tip. All in all I love these."
Don't use them much. Afraid of leaving sing them,Nita,3,2023-05-19,Keeps slipping out of ear
"Good, but I'm not sure I would buy them again.",Russell,4,2023-05-19,"Sound is good and I like the convince of wireless. After a while, the ear buds slip out of my ears, due to sweat."
Good worth for this price,sreekanth,4,2023-05-19,I like these head phones now my calls made easy to plug and talk.

,Maria,5,2023-05-18,"I love the easy way was for me to order the AirPods, easy delivery no mistakes. Right on time right on address."
Best Airpods in a Budget,Suraj,5,2023-05-18,The brand name Apple means pinnacle of quality and functionality when it comes to electronic gadgets. I bought the airpods on a sale for $80 and I think it was worth the money spent. Battery lifetime is best. Easy to use with an Apple iPhone but it does equally great job when connected to an Android phone like Samsung/OnePlus.

Like it,ricardom26,4,2023-05-18,Just don't have a little expensive as long as you take care of them they will ask you a very long time in my opinion. The speaker on them is amazing in my honest opinion sounds very good.
Practical,danielag24,3,2023-05-18,"I've had them for a year. They used to work perfectly fine. However, now they do not connect automatically to my iPhone anymore. I have to manually connect them at every use. Yes worth the price, but could use some improvement."
Excellent value.  Thank you.,Curtis,5,2023-05-17,I've already have a pair of these so I am happy enough with them to buy another at an excellent Walmart price. The pickup option at Walmart is very nice. The attendant was friendly and helpful.

"Quick charging, convenient",jenniferv329,4,2023-05-17,I liked the first generation AirPods. I thought that they fit well in my ear. I liked that I could wear them and be using them while I was charging the case. I would often put them in and go running and then come back and the case was charged. I thought they were convenient and I never lost mine. I had a case that clipped to my keys

not bad for a Zulu talking item.,Marissa,5,2023-05-16,never in my life have i ever bought an item that is so amazing it is small but big also this item plays music and it also speaks Zulu to its friends. i wanted to return this item but the item spoke to me and said if then be it that i return him he will no longer be my friend but he said it in Zulu so i have no clue what to do someone please help.

Great but beware ear wax,chesssoiree,4,2023-05-15,"I love using the original AirPods for running because they stay in my ears very well during activity. However, I had to upgrade to AirPod pros because the older versions would easily get eat wax in the speaker screen and the audio became less and less clear. I tried cleaning them with vinegar and a q tip but it didn't work. I only use these for running or exercise and use the updated version for every day use."

I tried cleaning them with vinegar and a q tip but it didn't work. I only use these for running or exercise and use the updated version for every day use."
,Robert,1,2023-05-15,The left AirPods out the blue stopped working and don't charge
It's okay,riav5,4,2023-05-15,"Whenever you remove the AirPods from your ears they automatically disconnect with the device. Otherwise they are fine, they have a sleek design."
Go to headphones,amayahs1,4,2023-05-14,These are a great pair of earbuds and they last a long time. The wireless charging case is also very convenient and they have a nice sound. Also they are very affordable
Slides out,hanas42,3,2023-05-14,"I really do like my AirPods, but they do not stay in my ears! I have the smallest buds in place but they still fall out. Maybe my ears are too small, I have no clue. I can only wear them around the house because I am afraid they will get lost if they fall out when Im at the gym or elsewhere. The sound quality is amazing and I love the noise cancellation on these. So it makes me sad that I can't wear them everywhere."
Liked these pros are better,abigailh159,4,2023-05-14,These were great wore them daily until I upgraded to the pros. Wore them while working in a woodshop/fabrication environment and they held up impressively.

They were great‚Ä¶ no so much anymore,thisguyariq,3,2023-05-13,"They were great when I first got them, but I feel now that the AirPods Pro were released, these don't work as great. It's difficult to hear when using at the gym."
They're okay,samcarpentertx,3,2023-05-13,"So these work great, I have no complaints there. I simply dislike these type of hard ear buds because shortly after wearing them my ears begin to hurt really bad."

My daughter loves them,teisham5,4,2023-05-12,My daughter loves thems and uses them all the time. She loses them often as well but can easily track them from her phone. The battery lasts for a long time which is awesome! Overall good purchase for a teenager. The one downsize is they hurt her ears after a while

Good but the new one are better,rubyr130,4,2023-05-11,"They're good for sure, nothing is wrong with them, but the newer versions have much better audio quality and other features like noise cancelling!"
Okay!,trinityyy,3,2023-05-11,These are really good quality but they hurt my ears so bad! They don't fit my ears at all! They are also so easy to loose. I wish they would bring the sting ones back!

iphone air pods,tiphphanyanne,1,2023-05-11,hasnt even been a year and they died. i already got 2 of them a few years back and still work. wonder if they have given me a messed up pair.
Still works fine,mindyp39,4,2023-05-10,"I've had these for a long time, and they're like a loyal friend! They've been with me through thick and thin and are still going strong. I think the sound quality is one of my favorite things about these AirPods. Thank you, Apple for making a solid product going strong for many many years!"
Not worth it,elizabethcorie,2,2023-05-10,"These are alright when you first purchase them but within a few months, the battery is shot. Mine hold charge for about two and a half hours at best, it's not worth it for the price. I'll stick with my wired headphones!"
Battery life becomes eh,annoor,2,2023-05-09,"I bought my second pair because the first pair started glitching to the point where one would die within minutes of use and the other would take forever to charge. For the price range apple has been going on, they need to do better."
Great,margotj2,4,2023-05-09,Ôøº Great product very fast charging. Ôøº it also has great audio that sounds like there is no noise from the outside because it's noise canceling so amazing. Ôøº
Good but not mindlowing,stephanien178,4,2023-05-09,"Maybe I have weird ears or something but I have tried all the ear tips and I can never get a perfect fit, which is something I assume would occur with such pricey headphones.

Great quality,darwinnm,4,2023-05-08,"The sound quality, like most apple headphones, is phenomenal. Though, if you're looking for noise cancelling, these are not the headphones for you. This works well for me though as I often wear them at work. I can listen to my music and podcasts, but can still hear if an alarm goes off or if someone starts talking to me. For me it has great battery life. I have yet to have the earbuds die while I'm using them -- the charging case is quite convenient. I started with the 3rd generation airpods (but I lost them at the airport), which has a more dynamic touch sensor (tap once to play/pause, tap twice to either skip backward or forward). These second generation headphones do not have a single touch option, so I have to click twice on the left ear to play/pause and twice on the right ear to skip forward. Meaning, you can only have two commands through the airpods, one for each ear, but you are able to set what you would like those to be. It makes no sense to me why an airpod can detect a double tap, but not a single tap? If you can afford it, I would get the 3rd generation airpods, which also have a surround sound feature. Since I need the lower price, these airpods work for me. They also have worked great for me while talking on the phone. I have difficulty when there are heavy winds (I live in the city and spend a lot of time walking outside), but otherwise the input and output quality is great on phone calls."

They're fine,mckinnae,3,2023-05-08,These are definitely not the most comfortable headphones if you have smaller ears. The sound quality was fine and all other functions worked great. But they were very uncomfortable to wear
Pretty good,caro813,3,2023-05-08,These AirPods are pretty good. The audio quality is good and the battery life is good too. The only thing is they don't really stay in my ears very well. They tend to get caught on my hair or just fall out if I move too quickly.

Fake Account,Bernard,1,2023-05-07,I Never Brought This Idem
Apple AirPods,amandah012881,4,2023-05-07,Apple AirPods with charging case work great for listening to music. I absolutely love the pair I got. I've had them a little over a year and received them for Christmas. The sound quality is excellent and I've had no problems this far. They are more on the expensive side so that's why I gave it 4 stars. I feel like the price should be more affordable for all.
Ok but pros are better,mussiez,3,2023-05-07,They fall out a lot so I would suggest spending the extra money on the pros because they actually stay in. The quality is good though but they don't have noise canceling.
Fake Account,Bernard,1,2023-05-07,I Never Brought This Idem
Not as good as I thought,melodya51,2,2023-05-06,I really loved them at first but after two months of use the right side stopped working and wouldn't play sound at a high level and in general the sound quality lessens over time.
,WalmartCustomer,1,2023-05-06,I never ordered this product. I can't afford to. I don't know how this purchase was made in my name but I am trying to figure that out at the present time. I'm sure the product is great.
Bring with me everywhere,abbeyj3,4,2023-05-05,I have had my pair of AirPods for almost three years now and they haven't failed me yet! They do seem to lose battery a lot quicker now than they used to but have held out this long!
,WalmartCustomer,1,2023-05-05,Have not received product yet. Was supposed to be delivered 2 days ago. I can not rate something I do not have.

Fun,samh168,4,2023-05-03,The apple AirPods are always on me on the go. To be fair they came be a little expensive but you wouldn't regret your purchase. They are good traveling partners
Okay product,lesliev89,3,2023-05-03,This product was given to me as a gift and I do use it but not often. Sometimes it take forever to connect to the Bluetooth. I will recommend the AirPods Pro
Great! For a while‚Ä¶,camryns19,3,2023-05-03,"I have had two pair of these and neither survived more than a year. I had the same issue with both: eventually the main speaker would go out, and I would have to put them in the opposite ears to hear out of the smaller side speaker."
Cool and convenient‚Ä¶,tashyrag,4,2023-05-03,"I got these as a gift, and I love them. The sound is good, but what I love most is their functionality. The small build, compact case, and on-the-go charging capabilities are ideal. I'm not sure I'd buy them for myself, though. I use them mostly for podcasts, not music, so, for my purposes, a cheaper alternative would be just fine. They're nice, though, and since I have them, I'm most certainly enjoying them."
They are good,clairef82,3,2023-05-03,I love my AirPods! They are so easy to use and travel with! I love that there are no wires! My only complaint is that they die so fast and don't hold their charge at all

Excellent earbuds with amazing sound!,brianc50,4,2023-05-02,My first ear buds that I've used in over 5 years and it was worth the purchase! They have amazingly clear sound for any type of music. The microphone can be put towards either ear and picks up your voice in any environment. They allow you to control your iPhone as we with touch points on each bud that can be programmed to do certain things. It is limited in your options but those options are enough to satisfy you ability to customize. Get some today!
,julie,1,2023-05-02,They don't work!!! 2nd pair that 1 will work and not the other.
Good quality,hannahp369,4,2023-05-02,This product lasted me about a couple days of full time use. The battery life is beyond exceptional and doesn't need charged for multiple days at a time.
Poor,presleytad4e,2,2023-05-02,I like that they are wireless but they cannot go as high as I wanted to. When I did it didn't have any bass and I hated not being able to feel the beat. And eventually they stopped working.

Overall good,rosiew21,4,2023-04-30,Overall a good product but the pros are better. These don't block out noise but good sound quality as can be expected from apple. The price isn't too bad especially now that the pros are out

Great sound quality without having bulky earbuds,fmamdani,4,2023-04-28,Love how small and light they are with great sound quality. One downside for me personally is that it sometimes falls out of my ears randomly so I can't imagine working out with it.
No Turning back!,dandreac1,4,2023-04-28,I have gone through a few pairs of these AirPods because I misplaced them but that shows you how much I love them because I can't go without them. They are my favorite accessory for my iPhone.

Airpods are a great product.,autumnp65,4,2023-04-27,"They are very small and easy to carry around, and if you want to decorate them there are many cases that you can put on.

Not for people with small ears!,marya312,4,2023-04-26,"Functionally, these are great. They charge well, stay charged, and are a great size. I have really small ears though and I am scared to wear them while I'm walking around, so be careful if you have small ears!"
The sound is good,ceras2,4,2023-04-26,I love anything apple really. The sound was awesome but I personally don't like how they fit it's almost like they just kept slipping out of my ear so working out or walking anything I would have to constantly push them back in. But good otherwise.

Great headphones but wish they were more comfortab,marykatej2,4,2023-04-26,I love my AirPods! I'm amazed at how long the stay charged and I've had them for years. They're easy to connect and don't take up much space in a carry on. My ears do start to hurt after wearing them for an extended time.

Hassle free,elizap30,4,2023-04-26,"Apple AirPods with charging case offer wireless and hassle-free audio experience with high-quality sound and convenient charging. The earbuds are lightweight and comfortable to wear for extended periods, and the automatic pause and resume feature adds to the overall convenience of the product. However, the lack of noise-cancellation may be a drawback for some users in noisy environments."
Must have,amocatjanie,4,2023-04-26,"If you have an iPhone, then you know there are an essential part of owning said phone. Sound is clear and crisp. Use while doing laundry, at work, working out or doing yard work. Perfect everywhere"
Just ok,sarasdawn918,4,2023-04-25,For expensive ear buds you would expect perfect but unfortunately these are not. They have a ridiculous time connecting to my phone. They only thing I will say that's great is the charge lasts forever on these!

I have had these headphones for 1 year and a half and they have lose the quality and volume. They are not as loud as they used to be. I feel that if they are this expensive they should not lose the volume quality that quickly.

"I use all the time, just a little basic.",anniem170,3,2023-04-25,I use these air pods everyday. In college walking to and from class as well as sharing a space with roommates having these comes in handy. I would just say there is nothing super fancy or special about the air pods. Nothing bad to say but nothing extraordinary either.
Good headphones,kamrynk5,4,2023-04-24,"This pair of headphones has great audio quality. Though the headphones can loose it's good audio quality over time, when your listening to music no one can hear them but the one with the headphones in which is great! There are cheaper options but I do recommend these."
Not consistent but usually good,edinygma,4,2023-04-24,Mine tend to break after a few months of use and sound quality decreases. But usually Apple is pretty good about replacing/fixing them when this happens.
They stop working !!!,vonniew1,1,2023-04-24,They always stop working so fast . It's very annoying. I literally barely used them & my right ear phone just broke out of no where & it's so many more people who had the same experience
Good for a while.,nikkic167,3,2023-04-24,"Great for a while! Until they start to get dirty and clogged with no way to fix it, and the sound quality gets ruined. Okay overall, but not my favorite pair of headphones I've ever had."
Good headphones,kamrynk5,4,2023-04-24,"This pair of headphones has great audio quality. Though the headphones can loose it's good audio quality over time, when your listening to music no one can hear them but the one with the headphones in which is great! There are cheaper options but I do recommend these."
Love love love,juliav120,4,2023-04-23,I use these daily and I would say they are an absolute necessity/must buy! The only thing is that they don't have noise cancellation like the AirPod pros do (I have both) so I would recommend buying the pros if you can!
Nice but I prefer wire,oliviab418,4,2023-04-23,"I am an original wire headphone girl! These are nice and I like how you can track them so they aren't that easy to loose, but I prefer my wire headphones"
Not worth it at all,Keaton,2,2023-04-23,These are so bad for how much you spend on them. To spend $100 and then have the sound get so quiet you can barely hear anything coming out of them within a year toa year and a half of owning them is ridiculous. I'll never pay for this overpriced garbage again.

Convienent,annat1911,4,2023-04-23,"I like these headphones because they are convenient when you need to be hands free, with that being said.. if you do your research there are tons of companies out there that have made similar headphones and in my opinion are better and more comfortable."

Great headphones,katies671,4,2023-04-23,I've been using airpods for years now and they're very comfortable and convenient. Battery life lasts a long time and they're easy to connect to my phone. My only complaint would be they never seem to connect to the Find My app which would be super helpful considering how easy to lose they are.

Product performance deteriorates over time,mariactay,3,2023-04-22,"Been using my AirPods for 4+ years already and though it's still working it's not functioning as good as it used to. Oftentimes my airpods would have a hard time connecting to my phone, my airpods are barely detectable, won't even connect even if it's already inserted in my ear. Sometimes it would even disconnect despite being recently charged. This product does have good features though such as assigning commands per left and ride side, my right airpod can pause music while the left side can play the next track. Sound quality is also nice. Overall, I would recommend but expect the performance to deteriorate over time."
Doesn't fit well,honge,3,2023-04-22,"The sound quality isn't bad and the battery life if the ear buds and case last a long time after one full charge. However, it doesn't sit well j. My ear and falls out easily. For regular use of listening to music this isn't an issue but I wouldn't be able to run or do more strenuous work outs with them"
oh my,theisrawr,4,2023-04-22,i lost these the first 5 months i got themüò≠üò≠. But im not mad because they did the job and we're soo cutesy likeeeee. Get these if you enjoy simple and comfortable listening.
Good Bluetooth Earphones,laurenr393,4,2023-04-22,"This was my first pair of AirPods, and they served me well. The wireless charging case was really nice and could hold a charge for a long time. The AirPods' sound quality was good and they were easy to use. Sometimes after wearing them for a while they hurt my ears."

Overrated but ok,alexisr81,3,2023-04-21,I think these are overrated. They work fine and get the job done but I do not personally understand all the hype about this product. They hurt my ears a bit and do not seem to be any better than my Bose or beats for example sound quality wise. I do enjoy the chargeable case however.
if i could give this no stars i would,sherilynne,1,2023-04-21,they only worked for two months then they stopped working music wasn't loud and could barely hear

Die quick,adrianas167,4,2023-04-21,I love my air pods but I feel like the microphones goes so quickly! I feel I need to replace them often. Also on runs it seems that they allow to much wind so hard to hear music sometimes
if i could give this no stars i would,sherilynne,1,2023-04-21,they only worked for two months then they stopped working music wasn't loud and could barely hear
"Good, but doesn't last forever",jennaw107,4,2023-04-21,"I love my airpods! Only negative was I felt like the sound quality decreased over time. But that was after constant use for 2-3 years. I found them to be great for casual use, less for exercise"
Bad,anthony,1,2023-04-20,Item came damaged and missing parts
they work great but barely fit in my ears,autumnc58,4,2023-04-20,my ears are naturally small and most earbuds don't fit so these not fitting didn't surprise me but even when they didn't fit they were still pretty comfortable
That they don't die fast,haidenl1,4,2023-04-20,They are good but they are always falling out of my ears so I'm not sure if I like them to much because of that but if they fit they are very comfortable and sometimes I forget that they are in my ears
,WalmartCustomer,5,2023-04-20,The product was on sale for an amazing price! They are perfect quality as I would expect from Walmart electronics. I've used the AirPods three times already for jogging in the great weather we're having.
Lacks feature but overall good,starmiec,4,2023-04-20,"It's great and definitely can last you but the age shows itself and features are not up to date for example each AirPods can only do one thing like skip a track and you can't change volume on them which is something you can find with cheaper earbuds,"

,Patricia,3,2023-04-19,One ear bud stoped working after a couple months
Not that great,caitlinj44,3,2023-04-19,"I guess my experience with these is coming straight from the first gen galaxy buds and they are far superior to my AirPod pros. The sound is better. The functions are better and more customizable. These are okay, though."
Pretty good,juliaf168,4,2023-04-19,I truly use my airpods every day. I love how easily they connect to my phone and they last for several hours and charge very quickly. The only downside is that they get dirty easily which impacts the sound quality. I would recommend cleaning them regularly to prevent this. Otherwise they're an essential!
,WalmartCustomer,1,2023-04-19,Never received it. Did not order it. Fraud.
Great for about a year,sugaseoul,4,2023-04-19,Sound quality is great if you maintain cleaning it every now and then but make sure you don't damage it while cleaning it or it will lose its functionality.
Good wireless earphones,bettyy4,4,2023-04-19,"Works well, the charge isn't significantly long. Comfortable hanging in the ears compared to newer noise canceling model. Battery in case that charges AirPods on the go."
Good connectivity but overly priced,subeg,2,2023-04-18,Beside the brand look and good connectivity there is nothing appealing about these AirPods. The sound quality and the fit is poor. I would look at the aftermarket options for better fit and better quality sound.
fall out of ears,audrianan,4,2023-04-18,"i wanted to like these and i feel like everyone else i know does, but they don't fit my ears i guess! they fall out and when i fix them i end up hitting something i'm not supposed to and messing up whatever i'm listening to."

Okay,punchiy,3,2023-04-18,"Too be honest, I started to think Apple products are overrated. I have been an Apple user for so many years, and new products just keep disappointing me. I got this new Airpods and it kept having issues connecting to my iPad, plus the batter is drained very quickly. I hope they care more about the quality that actually worth the price we are paying for."
Not comfortable in ears,alyssas397,4,2023-04-18,"I have the original AirPods and the AirPod pro version. I will say if you are between both, go with the Pro version! Yes, they are more expensive but worth it for the comfort and do not fall out! This version is also not noise cancelling. I will say these hold a great charge and can have multi use before needing to charge them!"
After three years of use‚Ä¶,lilym227,3,2023-04-17,"I've used my AirPods since 2019 and they have always come in handy. Easy to pair/disconnect, good sound quality. I will say that working out in them is just alright, I struggle when I'm doing a lot of movement to keep them in! The other thing I've noticed recently is that the battery is dying faster than it used to."
,Tonia,4,2023-04-16,They are hard to stay in ears and hurt a bit but overall great pair of headphones
Work well but nothing amazing,lillyu5,4,2023-04-16,This is a nice product and I would recommend to others. I use them everyday all the time and they work very well but it is nothing amazing compared to other products.
Horrible flowers,Stacy,2,2023-04-16,The flowers the shopper picked were horrible dry and almost dead. We couldn‚Äôt even make most of them stand up. They just flopped. Horrible
My favorite,jasminec291,4,2023-04-16,"This is one of my favorite products from apple. I love how it's Bluetooth and how easily it connects when I just turn it on. I hate how small it is because it can be easily lost or dropped but other than that, it's my go to!"

Sound quality,Teresa,4,2023-04-16,I get the best sound when I actually push and hold them in my ears.
Great for traveling!!,emileey1,4,2023-04-15,I have had these Apple AirPods for years now and they are still in perfect condition. I take these whenever I go out anywhere and leave them in my purse. They are small and easy to carry around which makes them great for travel. The battery life is pretty good on these as well and so is the sound quality! The only thing I wish was better was that there is a delay when creating TikToks with AirPods and I wish the mic quality could be better as it sounds very far away and muffled when connected.

Decent,thaliap847,3,2023-04-14,"I love Apple products but this was probably my least favorite. Not apples fault that I have small ears lol so after a while it would hurt to have the headphones in. The longer I had my headphones, the more connection issues I had with them. I also had a hard time keeping them both charged at the same level."

,JaMyia,5,2023-04-14,No word‚Äôs they‚Äôre amazing but they need to work on delivery bc they are in a regular Walmart bag and could easily be spotted and stolen.
Background noise cancellation,randac4,4,2023-04-14,When I put these headphones on it cancels out any background noise which is great! The only thing I wished that they would be is waterproof cause my old pairs tell me they definitely aren't. This feature would be great for lounging in the pool!
Ideal,vvsimmons,4,2023-04-14,"Ideal basic generic loveable pair of ear buds. Wires are too much of a hassle! Especially with all those tangles! Sadly without wires, these are prone to getting lost!! Not sure how but we managed to lose 2 pairs! Within 1 year so... Not sure if we should get more or not... Don't really use them often though since I need to hear 24/7 of my surroundings with 3 toddlers. Very expensive though, should be 1/3 it's price."

iffy,ashleyl643,3,2023-04-12,I would go for more of a headphone that sits around you head then these. these fall out so easily and can cause pain to the ear. they also get very gross
Great product but not long lasting,masha679,4,2023-04-12,"I loved these airpods more than i like the new pro version, but i went through 2 pairs that both encountered the same issue with the microphone breaking due to the mesh getting dirty. both times apple couldn't fix the issue at all which was pretty unfortunate."
,WalmartCustomer,5,2023-04-12,That was a great price compared to other retailers. There free shipping and next day delivery were much appreciated.
Better than the Gen 3 AirPods,Jason,5,2023-04-12,Much better than the gen 3 air pods. These are smaller and feel like they fit better. You can actually run with these without feeling like they will fall out. Battery life is great.

Small and functional,averyn11,4,2023-04-05,I love the original AirPods as they fit your ears so nicely! They are comfortable and easy to manage. Only downfall is they do not noise cancel at all however you have to buy the other style for that and I prefer the original style for fit

Necessity for working out,stephaniek182,4,2023-04-05,"These are a necessity for my! I use these every time I work out. I also have been using them for long phone calls while cleaning so I don't need to hold my phone while chatting! Super convenient. They do sometimes hurt my ears, but that's a me problem I think.. not the AirPods themselves!"
AirPods,Salid,4,2023-04-05,"They sort of slide out of my ear, but other then that its just basic and easily accessible."
Get the job done,morgan229,4,2023-04-04,Great little bluetooth headphones. Sound is good and convenientfor trying to block out noise or people more discretely. They also make good gifts
Sound is great; fit is not,teddic3,2,2023-04-04,"I love the concept of small wireless earphones but not the reality. They all fall out of my ears all the time! It's obviously my ear that is the problem b/c they stay in other ears fine! I have to use full over the head speakers, which. Give me a headache after a while. It's unfortunate because I love to listen to long podcasts while I walk and would love to not have a headache afterwards!"
Pretty great!,tessar54,4,2023-04-04,"These are compact and light enough that I can take them anywhere. They also hold their charge for a long time‚Äîaround 3-4 hours at least. I often don't charge them for days. The noise canceling works relatively well, but not as much as over the ear headphones (sometimes it picks up voices). One star off because they get uncomfortable after a while and when I'm talking on the phone they pick up background noise for the person I'm talking with."
,Jamese,1,2023-04-04,It came in the package broke
Doesn't fit ears well,grumpyprincess,1,2023-04-04,Doesn't fit ears well. Audio quality sucks. I don't recommend. The design is painful in the ears. It well built. And battery doesn't last long enough.
Lose sound quality fast,gracem355,3,2023-04-04,These AirPods are great but lose their life quickly over time. You constantly need to clean them so earwax doesn't build up in them. They lose their charge as well.
Decent price but I‚Äôd pay more for the real thing,tia,2,2023-04-04,They worked well for a month but halfway through the second month of having them the right earbud stopped working and wouldn‚Äôt connect to the case
Convenient,jocelynd51,4,2023-04-04,"I had AirPods and rarely used them, but now I wish I used them a little more. They're average sounding, nothing crazy, but so low key and convenient, no one will even know you're wearing them. They also have no cord so if you're on the move or cleaning, they're not getting in your way!"

Apple,mollymm36,4,2023-04-04,Well I am happy to be working out and not be getting worried I'm wrapped up in the electric cord Luke the old apple earbuds. But they sort of hurt your ears and so I took a star off
Great product!,anahir54,4,2023-04-03,"I absolutely love them, I've had this AirPods for 3 years now and they still work. I like how small they are because they don't get in the way. And I really like how the music sounds!"
Stop working after a while,lolak02,4,2023-04-03,"I loved my airpods for about a year or so, but after that they stopped working. they connect for a little bit and then completely turn off, which is frustrating for the price."
okay at best !,troik,4,2023-04-03,They work well but I found other people could hear what I was listening too ! Great purchase if willing to spend the money on them ! Also great for afternoon walk and listening to music
Airpods,quyenn8,3,2023-04-03,"My husband have one and he gave me one. Its really help me a lot at my job cause sometime i can't pick up my phone, but one thing i don't like it that if i wear too long my ear get so hurt. But Anyway i still really like it"
Great for iPhone users,fatallylovely,4,2023-04-02,"great sound, good bass and volume, fits well in ears. charging case works very well, only issue is minor glitches and easy to lose if not careful."
Modern technology,teresa,4,2023-04-01,I like everything other than than they make my ears sore and they‚Äôre way to expensive to lose but the sound is great n crystal clear ! They actually connect to my iPad and iPhone at the same time. I just wish they didn‚Äôt make my ears sore
Pretty great üëç,tiffanyd251,4,2023-04-01,I don't have a pair of apple airports myself but my friend did and I used hers they were really nice I liked them. They were loud and I like loud headphones especially when I'm listening to music
Easy Linking,aarong37,4,2023-04-01,AirPods are great for IOS users if only very their easy no hassle pairing. The sound on these is fantastic for a lower tier earbud. I prefer the pros but you can't go wrong with AirPods. Charging case makes charging to grab and go super easy
Meh,maritza17g,3,2023-03-31,I like it but the design is to uncontrollable for small ears like mines. I hope they make different colors. But the sound quality is really good üëçüèª
Convenient,taraw52,4,2023-03-31,"I love my AirPods, not having a wire has made it so much easier to listen to music while working out, walking, cleaning, etc. I have had them for about 3 years now and they definitely do not work as well as they used to"
LOVE,kearam7,4,2023-03-31,game changer!! these last so long without being charged and are so much more convenient than the headphones than the ones with the string. Be careful as they can fall out of your ears
Nice!,imanip4,3,2023-03-31,These AirPods aren't sure great but they are cool to use. The case charges very quickly and the only problem they have is they need to be a little louder.

apple airpods pro 2,mariamo21,3,2023-03-31,"The charger charges both headphones at different percentages, otherwise the battery lasts a long time. It has a quick reaction to a fall. ggggg"
Works well!,sapnaa1,4,2023-03-31,"Overall, I like AirPods. They're super convenient with no wires in the way and they're decently sized so they don't get lost too easily. Sound quality still lacks a bit, but it's not the worst!"
"Great sound, doesn‚Äôt work on 3-way charging pads.",abbeverycute,4,2023-03-31,These AirPods provide great sound. Hold their charge. Only negative is they don‚Äôt work on the three way pad chargers. This was the reason I bought them.
Love,phuongn23,4,2023-03-31,Doubt it at first but it turned out great with high quality audio and fit perfectly to your ears. Best product that can be used for more than 5 years
Go to headphones,maanasab,4,2023-03-31,"These are the best and easiest AirPods for me. I like them more than the AirPods Pro which squish my ears and are completely noise canceling. These are best for every day use, it's easy to take calls, music is clear, and you can walk around in a city with them in while still being aware of your surroundings."

Bad battery,,3,2023-03-31,"AirPod has really bad battery storage! With fully charged, I can only use in 6 hours. Also easy to fail from my ears and the sound not too good as other brand! I recommend the AirPod pro, I think it much better and worth it when you just pay little bit more!"
Excelent,miguela44,4,2023-03-31,This is in you moment in product with excellent sound and vers√°til solution in the sound referent fot other disposable Of iden l√≠nea u other similar
Exceptional!,jaypork,4,2023-03-30,"AirPods are an exceptional wireless earbud option that delivers high-quality audio and convenient functionality. The earbuds are easy to set up and connect seamlessly to any Apple device. The sound quality is excellent, with crisp and clear audio that allows you to enjoy your favorite music or podcast without any interference. The earbuds are also comfortable to wear, and the battery life is impressive, providing up to 5 hours of listening time on a single charge. The charging case is compact and convenient, and the earbuds automatically connect and disconnect when you put them in or take them out. Overall, a fantastic choice for anyone seeking a high-quality wireless earbud option that delivers excellent audio and convenience."
Nothing spectacular.,crich89,3,2023-03-30,Nothing special about them. They do their job. They hurt my ears though so I don't wear them long. I love that I was able to personalize my case. These are great for listening to music but not for making music.
Long lasting battery,elyssah2,4,2023-03-30,These are great! They charges quickly and last me days! I love how portable they are and that they can connect to any of my devices. They are a decent price for how they work.

Nice but charge doesn't last long,emilym1177,4,2023-03-29,"Airpods have become an essential part of my work day, it is so nice to not be tethered to my phone by a headphone chord. However. I do wish the charge lasted long enough to get through a full work day."

Great Wireless Headphones!,emmab686,4,2023-03-29,I have loved my AirPods since i first purchased them! The only thing I wish they did different was the noise canceling feature. Unlike the new airpod pro's they are not noise canceling. Otherwise I love them!
Good Headphones,stephaniec821,4,2023-03-28,These are good headphones. The way they sync with your iPhone and apple devices is so seamless and convenient. The sound quality is good listening to music and during calls.
,WalmartCustomer,5,2023-03-28,I purchased this product for my husband. He loves the convenience of just tapping the AirPods to control its functions.
Long battery life,kelsieg11,4,2023-03-28,"I don't use them everyday, therefore battery life is about 2weeks. When I use them consistently, I charge them 1x a week. I have tried the pro version with noise cancellation and that is a game changer"
love,gabriels37,3,2023-03-28,I do really like this Apple product because these AirPods have incredible bass but the new ones have more of a controlled bass and loud system. ly
Delivery Date Not Respected,Luigi,1,2023-03-27,"The product that was needed for work, should have arrived the next day as specified during payment, instead it arrived in the afternoon after 2 days. No seriousness and precision"
"Reliable, long charge",mostlyjen,4,2023-03-27,"I've had these for years now, and they are still reliable. I sometimes have connectivity issues that are resolved within 5 minutes of consistently put them in the charger and taking them out again. Other than that, I use these when I workout and it's a lifesaver not having cords in the way."

Simple design and uncomplicated,babuelow,4,2023-03-25,I hate cords and have an iPhone so it's only natural that I bought a few of these for my family. The charge lasts a fairly decent amount of time and we all enjoy the sound quality. They stay well in our ears even while sweating!
Nice,kearahw,4,2023-03-25,They're pretty good the sound quality is dope but overall it's nice. I would appreciate the AirPods not dying a few minutes afterwards I prefer.

Great,kimh268,4,2023-03-25,I love my apple AirPods. I have had them for over four years now and they still work great. I use them to talk on the phone and to listen to audio books. They charge super quickly which is great.

Highly overrated,brytannebuffymcwilli,2,2023-03-23,"Easy to lose, easy to break, just as other headphones. But the problem is the price is RIDICULOUS! Why is this so necessary when you can buy some with cords and save money??"

Love‚Ä¶ but stopped working,elizabethg509,3,2023-03-23,"Love these! TLDR; I love to walking my dog in the morning, but always get so bored. I can't stand the pesky cord of my headphones, but once i switched to AirPods, it made walking (and talking on the phone) much easier and more bearable. The only complaint that I have is that the speaker stopped working in less than a year of use (I can hear audio but people can't hear me when on the phone). No water damage, always kept clean. Not sure what happened."

Nice Product,wetriedit,4,2023-03-22,I love these earbuds. They stay in place while moving around & cancel just the right amount of sound. The individual headphones do die a bit quick but they also charge super fast!
Don‚Äôt get them,Sebastian,2,2023-03-22,I got Thea‚Äôs air pods not that long ago from the store and I hade so many problems with them like they won‚Äôt charge and that the sound quality was terrible and the speakers stoped working and don‚Äôt get These from here get than straight from apple
Normal apple ear phones,caity_marieb,4,2023-03-22,Charging case is great they work wonderfully comfortable east to use and convenient to carry along anywhere . Great gift or stocking stuffer for any iPhone user.
I love them,Andrea,5,2023-03-22,Good sound and comfortable. I have 2 pairs that way I can switch out one while the other is charging. I love them.
Good option,luizar5,4,2023-03-22,"Very convenient for everyday use, the only issues I would have are the little rubber thingy that goes in the ear -they are kind of flimsy and could come off. Other than that the quality of the sound is pretty good so I would recommend these."
Garbage,Blake,1,2023-03-21,Absolute garbage. They do not fit my ears.
,John,1,2023-03-21,They fit really loose in my ears and seem like they could fall easily.
Ok but one side starts to sound lower after a peri,mssolana,4,2023-03-21,I've had mines for a couple of months and ofc I had to wait a while before I reviewed it. While using it I realized my left side AirPod started sounding lower. It has a long battery life tho but that's the only problem
Convenient and good sound quality but not great,ashlena2,4,2023-03-21,"Sounds quality is good, but not great. Nothing that would impress an audiophile. Comfort is lacking, after wearing for an hour or so, they become uncomfortable. Battery life is good and varies depending on use of listening to music or talking. It would be nice if they were noise canceling, however you would need to pay extra for the newer models for that feature. The charging case does a good job of recharging relatively quickly. Overall they're solid headphones but I wouldn't pay retail, there's deals to had if you browse around."
Good for a long time,brittany45,4,2023-03-21,"Love love love! Up until they stopped connecting, these were my babies. Eventually, I replaced them with a different pair of headphones, but I love these."
,Briana,2,2023-03-21,Right ear popped in my ear while shopping. Left ear piece was good. I think this set was previously used by someone else on my first day listening to music it advised me to turn it down. Max hearing over last 7 days. I haven‚Äôt had it for 7 days.

Comfort,ericas07,4,2023-03-19,They were all right. They worked great sound was awesome but I have never been a fan of any type of earbud headphones they just feel uncomfortable for me but my kids and husband love them because they can answer their phones hands free.
Bad for ears,heatherc479,2,2023-03-19,The amount of emf radiation these give off is insane. Super bad to have in your ears at all let alone an extended period of time. Also- it is super easy to loose a AirPod.

It was really convenient and I loved that I could keep one side in as I worked and still be able to hear what was going on around me then easily switch to the other airbud when it died. However I would never buy another pair I purchased two and both conveniently stopped working when my warranty was expired. Both are still functional. However, there is really loud feedback.Ôøº"
They're okay,jenniferr793,4,2023-03-18,"I've bought this two times bc I kept loosing the case or AirPods lol they're so easy to loose bc they're very comfortable to wear, you forget you have them on! The sound is okay. I now have the beats airbus's that I got as a gift from work and enjoy those more as they are comfortable but I can know if I have them. I also prefer them since they have the option for noise cancellation and noise transparency:)"

These are great but way too easy to lose,lillianq1,3,2023-03-17,The sound quality is pretty good but not really worth the price. It is a nice product though and I enjoy the packaging. They fit my ears well as well. The biggest downside is that they are so easy to lose. It may be user error but I always seem to lose one.

"Great sound quality, less than satisfactory UX.",ryan_c_bag,3,2023-03-16,"Bought these for work a couple years ago, I work in a metal/welding shop. The sound quality is great, like really good. Despite this, I never got used to how they fit, and never understood why Apple insists on this design. If you sweat or have oily ears, good luck using these, they constantly fall out of become loose. They're also an absolute dust magnet, because, well, they have magnets in them. I never had problems as I used an airgun to blow all the crap out on my way out of work. I had consistent problems (once to three times a week) where I put them in my ear and they didn't auto connect, or only one earbud connected. Overall, great build quality, great sound quality, but interesting (and in my opinion, flawed) design choices made by Apple. I would recommend Beats Powerbeats Pro over these, they are 10x better with the only drawback being the ugly case."
"Great, but stopped holding charge",mackenziet46,4,2023-03-16,"They were great for the first while, but after about a year they stopped holding a full charge. They would die after about an hour of using them. I still love them though!"

Good,tyffani813,4,2023-03-15,They work very well. Easy to carry around. The only thing I don‚Äôt like is how hard the case is to clean. Other then that I really love this products.
They‚Äôre okay,martinai23,4,2023-03-14,They did fall out of my ears occasionally. Maybe just mine are weirdly shaped üòÇ but also they are hard to clean up from the occasional ear wax let‚Äôs be honest we all have it. Should have come with a clean up tool or something
Works good and long battery life,ians23,4,2023-03-14,Easy to use and setup/connect to your phone. There is definitely quality in the sound and they have a good level of comfortability. Only problem is there are better products out there for a fraction of the price
CAn lose easily,melissam1120,3,2023-03-14,"Good sound but expensive and you can use these easily because they‚Äôre so small Ôøº. Wouldn‚Äôt recommend. Use regular ear buds instead . I see people who have cords attached to these air buds so they don‚Äôt lose them, so what is the point if you‚Äôre attaching the cord to them they‚Äôre not wireless anymore. Ôøº"
Great to use as wireless headphones with iPhone bu,jenni8,3,2023-03-14,They are great to use hands free and are compatible with iPhone. It picks up your voice well when on calls. The issue I have is the sound quality. I expected more from apple and I went with the AirPods Pro because the quality is much better or the third generation of the AirPods are great alternative.
Terrible,Murphy,1,2023-03-14,I bought these for my grandson and the sound is terrible.. he can‚Äôt hear out of them .. and he‚Äôs very upset.. the window to return them has passed.. so I‚Äôm out $80.00 on something he‚Äôs had since January
I love it,izadorab2,4,2023-03-14,"I love these AirPods, they‚Äôre pretty comfortable and it‚Äôs easy to use, I love how you can answer phone questions and change songs and all that. Music quality is pretty balanced but lacks bass."
Dislike,Griselle,1,2023-03-13,I dont like this item. Runs out of battery too quickly. Within an hour and half use. I will return.
Good purchase.,mysticalNan,5,2023-03-13,"I have no dislikes, this is my second pair. My teen finally stole the first one. üòÇ No issues. Works as I expected."

Sleek and loud,angel17,3,2023-03-12,I love my Apple AirPods. I think it‚Äôs ridiculous with how the cord changes every five years. I personally think AirPods should be given with a new device purchase especially since they don‚Äôt give them with the phones.
,WalmartCustomer,4,2023-03-12,The product was perfect and good for its price

Good Sound,annalp,4,2023-03-12,"Good sound, convenient, and easy to use. Charges really quickly as well. The charging case is also a bonus. My only complaint is that the pods often fall out of my ears."
don't fit,p4l4a4y4,4,2023-03-12,They don't stay in my ears
"Sound is superb , but‚Ä¶",angelas439,3,2023-03-11,"The sound is very clear and picks up all the nuances of the music. The only complaint I have is when I only want to wear one of them, sometimes it won‚Äôt pair unless I put in both of them. Other times, it will work with just one."
Described as New but were Used,Julie,3,2023-03-11,The AirPods work perfectly ... however I purchased these as NEW but when we paired them to my son's phone they were already named so they were obviously used. It was a Christmas gift and we were leaving for Paris the next day so we choose to keep them. The condition of this product was misrepresented or a mistake was made when the order was fulfilled. Either way - disappointing.
Quick charging,mariialiahara,4,2023-03-11,"I like how small and well made the case is. It‚Äôs so convenient that I can protect and charge my AirPods at the same time. I‚Äôm glad with those,just wish they doesn‚Äôt fall so much from my ears ü§£ü§£ü§£"

Great Entry Level Headphones!,foodandlipstick,4,2023-03-10,"The sound quality is nice, they fit comfortably in my ears. I despise most silicone or foam tips. Maybe next time I‚Äôll upgrade to the AirPods Pro for better noise canceling, but I enjoy these. They switch so easily between devices!"
Uncomfortable,amandas1179,3,2023-03-10,"The shape of these do not work in all ear types. They are just too round for mine which makes them painful. However, the sound quality is very nice."
Easy pairing with the device,shivanid15,4,2023-03-10,These airpods are good handy and affordable options if you don‚Äôt want to buy out the expensive one need one from apple. Though battery degradation is a problem here but you can easily get battery life of 4-5 hours

,WalmartCustomer,3,2023-03-10,The only reason that I gave that specific rating for the quality of the product is because it was delivered to the wrong address and I do not have the product I was offered a refund
Easy to connect,nicolek433,4,2023-03-10,These are super easy to use and set up with whichever apple device you might have. The sound quality is good and call quality is great. The only downside I see is they don‚Äôt stay in your ears too well and can sometimes have difficulty connecting with your phone right away.
Good case,maggieo27,4,2023-03-09,"Case easily gets dirty after regular use and it‚Äôs tricky to clean, but overall I like that it charges quickly and constantly. I just wish I could see the percentages easily"
The bottom line,emilyyywooddd,4,2023-03-09,"If you're looking to just listen to music or a few podcasts, the AirPods (2nd generation) is a decent choice for iPhone owners, since the connection never drops and total battery life is pretty good. You won't get great sound out of these earphones, but that's not the point. If you're willing to sacrifice comfort for convenience, then the second-generation AirPods makes sense. Otherwise, we implore you to look at other options."
Meh,migler2,3,2023-03-09,These hurt my ears if I wear them any longer than an hour or so. The sound quality isn‚Äôt great and i think they could be louder. I like how small they are and convenient to travel with but they aren‚Äôt my favorite.
Headphones,meganl350,4,2023-03-09,I use my headphones all the time. I‚Äôve own apple products for a few years now and its by far my favorite. It‚Äôs convenient and small so it fits in my purse or my pocket.
Airpods,jacek3,4,2023-03-09,"I like the idea of airpods and I certainly get a lot of use out of mine, however they can be quite uncomfortable for me at times and don‚Äôt quite fit my ear shape. I made the switch to headphones and love them."
Great sound but fall out üòï,nunnb,4,2023-03-09,Love these for workout out but dislike that there is no rubber portion on the older models so when you sweat a lot it goes straight onto the plastic or the speaker portion and it‚Äôs hard to clean. Also if you sweat a lot due to the rubber portion no being there the headphones will fall out. Not always the case but does occur. Not necessarily meant for lots of jumping movements but not a huge issue when running.
Lasted a long time but not forever,khern2005,3,2023-03-09,"These headphones were super great when I first bought them. Over time, as the newer models started coming out, my AirPods started relying more on the charging box and started to not connect or produce sound. It‚Äôs a good investment but just know they will eventually start having problems."
Not bad but pros better,carderiusm,3,2023-03-09,So these were okay for the moment but its definitely better options . I do like the ease of connecting though but the sound quality just isn't up to par with other
AirPods,terrao4,3,2023-03-09,"Audio quality is good but they look so stupid. I hat he one-inch white stick hanging out of my ears and others‚Äô. Other brands work just as well, if not better. I‚Äôm done with these"
Best,innav3,4,2023-03-09,I can listen music on my phone at my job. But need to use some air pods or headphones. Apple AirPods is the best what I have ever used. It‚Äôs fit for my ears.

Airpods,laurief29,2,2023-03-09,"Didn‚Äôt like how they kept falling out my ears , and so big . They didn‚Äôt have different sizes to fit different ears. Just didn‚Äôt like"
they‚Äôre alright,adrial5,2,2023-03-09,when they‚Äôre brand new they sound great. however after having them in for awhile they hurt my ears and the sound started to get really bad. there are better headphones out there for sure.
Good,jaynej8,4,2023-03-09,"They actually do stay in your ears. It is so convenient to have the charging case in a little pause like it is. You also charge the case with your iPhone charger, which makes it even more convenient. Ôøº"
Airpods,isabelv98,4,2023-03-09,"I had these before I got the airpods pro and they were great, however, they‚Äôre definitely lacking noise cancellation and didn‚Äôt fit my ears super well."
Good Headphones,alexiss323,4,2023-03-09,"I really like my air pods, they have lasted for years and I still use them. Slightly uncomfortable after long wear time, but overall feel nice and stay in your ears well. Definitely would recommend! Charge pretty quickly as well."
Great music,emilyk404,4,2023-03-09,I love my AirPods! I prefer them over the pros because these are the classic earphone shape. The ones with rubber don‚Äôt fit my ear so these fit me really well.
Lasted a long time but not forever,khern2005,3,2023-03-09,"These headphones were super great when I first bought them.

Fast charge,blancav49,4,2023-03-09,"It is very practical and fast charging,, the phone connects quickly without any problem, the sound is of good quality, the only problem is the case is damaged very quickly on the outside, I would like them to make it from a different material that does not scratch on the outside so that it lasts longer in better conditions"
Music,angied138,3,2023-03-09,I love my apple air pods. I have had mine for over 2 years now and they have been working amazingly. I have not had any trouble out of them yet. The bass in them sound amazing also.
The struggle is real,diamondhaus,3,2023-03-09,I have bought every Apple ear pod AirPod. And not one of them still has both left and right ear. It is so frustrating. I can‚Äôt even believe how much money have wasted.
room for improvement,ashleym1392,4,2023-03-09,I‚Äôve had these for 3 years and they‚Äôre good but they could be great. after awhile the sound faded and isn‚Äôt as loud as it used to be. Definitely wish they were louder
On the go charging made simple!,roberts87,4,2023-03-09,Wireless charging case is great! Especially on the go! Being able to have my headphones charge while I‚Äôm waking around and can‚Äôt have them in is great. And they charge them quick when not plugged in!
Not worth the $,ashleys1041,2,2023-03-09,These sound the same as the wired ones but just cost way more. You‚Äôre paying extra money just for them to be wireless. Save your money and buy a pair with better sound quality.
Convient Charging,gloriellyg,4,2023-03-09,You know you have a wireless charging case if there‚Äôs an indicator light on the front of the case. It‚Äôs so nice to be able to lay the case on a charging mat when its not in use. Especially since the case itself doesn‚Äôt hold a charge for very long. If you‚Äôre a constant AirPods user like me it‚Äôll last maybe 2 days.
Disapointed,ceciles19,2,2023-03-09,"I love these AirPods. They have a beautiful sounds, they fit perfectly to my ears but I am very disappointed. Sometimes one of them just stop working, and it is been my third pair as after usually a year they start to have issues. I love Apple products but they should be able to make a product that last longer."
Weird technology,nauticaf,4,2023-03-09,Sometimes they work & sometimes they go out . I‚Äôm wondering if I need to upgrade them since they are 1st generation . Besides that i love the convenience it brings.
Had troubles getting it connected,hannahb648,3,2023-03-09,"I love how small and easy these are to carry out and use. Only problem I had was trying to get both earbuds to connect, sometimes I have troubles with one disconnecting but other than that I love them. They also have the option to shut off background noise so you strictly can hear music."

Convenient,alyssaf172,3,2023-03-09,For the most part I really like the Apple AirPods. I feel like the things that would bug me were if I wore them to the gym they would fall out and sometimes I couldn‚Äôt find them. Also after a while they would stop being as loud and they used to be when they‚Äôre brand new. Another thing is that they die kind of fast. But I do like how portable they are.
Great headphones considering the launch year/price,justinr46,4,2023-03-09,"I love my original apple airpods. They have a built-in mic and sound fantastic for the year they were released. My only con would be how fast they die these days!! Otherwise, I highly recommend!"

Convenient but may stop working properly,selag,4,2023-03-09,"Nice and compact. However after a month of using the battery life went down significantly, and the left AirPod‚Äôs volume is permanently lower than normal. I have to only use one AirPod at a time to maximize the battery life and doing this only gets me about 4 hours."

Not bad but pros better,carderiusm,3,2023-03-09,So these were okay for the moment but its definitely better options . I do like the ease of connecting though but the sound quality just isn't up to par with other
Not Ideal for Cardio Workouts,maddiemscott,3,2023-03-09,The Airpods slide out of your ears when you start to sweat or move to quickly. The battery does last a while thanks to the charging case. They are perfect for traveling but do start to hurt your ears after about an hour of use.
Not as well,arij13,3,2023-03-09,When I first bought my AirPods I was excited to use them and yes the audios sounds great but after some few months they stop working and only one pear works.

Very cool,patricias285,4,2023-03-09,These AirPods are in their very own charging case and are simple to keep up with and carry. They are comfortable and work really great. I‚Äôd recommend them.
love this,nevianam,4,2023-03-09,I LOVE my airpods! They are perfect for road-trips. I probably wouldn‚Äôt use them to workout just because they fall out of my ear sometimes but my ears could just be weird
Kinda okay,raafagrossi,3,2023-03-09,"That‚Äôs good, when it‚Äôs new. Eventually (in my case, 3 months latter), the battery gets all messed up and just one plug works"
Hurts ears,tylerw64,3,2023-03-09,"For people with sensitive ears like me these can hurt where the airpod fits in. It‚Äôs uncomfortable for a bit at the begging but at the end it hurts. Not to put down the product, these work pretty well, just not for me."

The Best AirPods,carinelm,4,2023-03-09,This AirPods are the most better that i try it. The sound was so Good & perfect. I really like the adaptation of the ear since they do not come out or fall out
Good but not that good,marianar262,3,2023-03-09,"I love them and they are easy to use when you‚Äôre working out. But I think that across the time, the volume is getting down‚Ä¶"

Loveeeee,annier75,4,2023-03-09,I absolutely love the Apple AirPods. I literally used them every day. They stay in my ears and that they are great for anyone who is on the move or need them at the gym. I definitely recommend. Ôøº
Good,chloew251,4,2023-03-09,They are good until a newer version comes out and your sound decreases. As long as you keep them clean and charged you‚Äôll be good.
2nd generation Airpods,karae29,4,2023-03-09,Sound quality is great and the convenience is something that I enjoy about the Airpods. The battery life is good and they don‚Äôt need much charging.

Works well,lisas689,4,2023-03-09,These work great with my iPhone. I also have smaller ears and they tend to stay out unlike others that fall out. The sound quality and battery life is pretty good too.
AirPods,peggyu,4,2023-03-09,They were good but I wasn‚Äôt that crazy about them. I gave them to my granddaughter and they quit working on her so I don‚Äôt know you.
they work most of the time,agdavidson55,4,2023-03-09,i‚Äôm on my 3rd pair of airpods. a single airpod came out of the case when i hadn‚Äôt used them at all that day so i replaced the whole thing. then that set started dying so i got a new (my current) set. sometimes they like to disconnect or they won‚Äôt fully make connection with the case. idk
Don‚Äôt fall out,whitneyr62,4,2023-03-09,The only earbuds that fit my ear without falling out! I‚Äôve tried multiple brands and these have been the best! The volume is pretty good on them too!
good!,maddiek85,4,2023-03-09,"i wish there was more cushion, as after time goes by, they can irritate my ears. they work really well and i totally recommend them!"
great,ashlynf23,4,2023-03-09,airpods are great and the pros noise cancelling is amazing but the fit is weird and it doesn‚Äôt always stay in your ear but still love it

Music,angied138,3,2023-03-09,I love my apple air pods. I have had mine for over 2 years now and they have been working amazingly. I have not had any trouble out of them yet. The bass in them sound amazing also.
Ok,johnnyo5,3,2023-03-09,"These airpods were ok. Sound quality was ok, definitely a step up from most ear buds but nothing remarkable. They look very sleek and sophisticated, however the audio completely stopped working in one of the airpods 2 years after i got them which is pretty annoying for such a pricey product."
i love them,allisonv113,4,2023-03-09,I like them a lot i just hate when they die lol but that‚Äôs with anything. right now i have two different airpods so when one dies i use the other one. other than that they are casual and great sound!
Amazing,Vanessa,5,2023-03-09,I like them and they look great and the sound quality is awesome. Their is no dislikes on this item.
good!,maddiek85,4,2023-03-09,"i wish there was more cushion, as after time goes by, they can irritate my ears. they work really well and i totally recommend them!"
The bottom line,emilyyywooddd,4,2023-03-09,"If you're looking to just listen to music or a few podcasts, the AirPods (2nd generation) is a decent choice for iPhone owners, since the connection never drops and total battery life is pretty good. You won't get great sound out of these earphones, but that's not the point. If you're willing to sacrifice comfort for convenience, then the second-generation AirPods makes sense. Otherwise, we implore you to look at other options."
Better to buy next gen,giannac56,3,2023-03-09,Compared to the newer versions of the AirPods I definitely think it‚Äôs worth it to invest in the newer ones. This pair often hurts my ear after hours of use.
Good started Bluetooth headphones,haileec15,4,2023-03-09,These were a great starter headphone from apple I now have the upgraded version of pro and love them even more than the originals
"Good Comfort, Okay Sound",bertto,4,2023-03-09,"These are the comfiest type of earbuds that you will ever have, they haven‚Äôt fallen out of my ear once, and you could wear them for hours and hours with no discomfort. Only thing is the audio quality is okay at best, you won‚Äôt get a lot of the low ranges and it lacks some bass, but it does do the job"
"Good quality, low battery fast",postagebread,4,2023-03-09,It sounds good and even though they are large in the eat I enjoy using it and jamming out to my music. Only problem is how fast they die. I do have the first generation so it is pretty old by this point but they die within an hour of use.
Earpods,mistis8,4,2023-03-09,"Enjoyed was nice loud good volume easy to connect to phone and easy to find with phone , quality all together was well , wish came in other colors"
AirPods are good,westenh1,3,2023-03-09,I like the fact that it seamlessly syncs with the rest of my Apple devices. However it is not the best wireless headset ever. It also falls out frequently
airpods,ellak59,4,2023-03-09,love my AirPods and their case. i use them everyday and they have great sound quality. I also love using the feature where you can share music through others airpods.
Good,jm76,4,2023-03-09,They are good and I like them. Theres nothing special about them though. They get dirty really easily though which i don't like.
Hurts ears,tylerw64,3,2023-03-09,"For people with sensitive ears like me these can hurt where the airpod fits in. It‚Äôs uncomfortable for a bit at the begging but at the end it hurts. Not to put down the product, these work pretty well, just not for me."
Not as well,arij13,3,2023-03-09,When I first bought my AirPods I was excited to use them and yes the audios sounds great but after some few months they stop working and only one pear works.
Decent producf,mandisimo,4,2023-03-09,"These are decent AirPods, but they need to come down off the price. Initially, the price was crazy. Maybe they‚Äôre cheaper now but for the design and the quality they should not have been that expensive. Ôøº One thing I can say is that they have elite charging speeds. Ôøº Putting one airpod back in the case and it‚Äôll be fully charged in 15 minutes, not to mention the cases also charge pretty quickly.Ôøº A solid 7 out of 10, just because of the actual design of the AirPod not being one that conforms everyone‚Äôs ear Ôøºshape, And it doesn‚Äôt have a noise canceling."
Good,chloew251,4,2023-03-09,They are good until a newer version comes out and your sound decreases. As long as you keep them clean and charged you‚Äôll be good.
‚ù§Ô∏è,brendad119,4,2023-03-09,I love them I can‚Äôt stay whit out them I really think there‚Äôs no better then apple products umm I Definitely recommend if you haven‚Äôt tried them yetÔøº
They‚Äôre ok,alyshal6,4,2023-03-09,"They are okay , I think they are on par with with the cheaper Amazon ones . For the price I wasn‚Äôt expecting them to be so similar ."
Not Ideal for Cardio Workouts,maddiemscott,3,2023-03-09,The Airpods slide out of your ears when you start to sweat or move to quickly. The battery does last a while thanks to the charging case. They are perfect for traveling but do start to hurt your ears after about an hour of use.
On the go,ezoconvery,4,2023-03-09,"I am always listening to music or on the phone for work / catching up with friends and family. My AirPods are always with me meaning I can go hands free, sometimes I will chatting to someone while making dinner with my phone in the other room. I charge my airpods every night - I‚Äôve had them for 2 years now and have noticed the battery life starting to decline."
Phone issue,brittanym471,4,2023-03-09,I love my AirPods the only thing I have to say is that they don‚Äôt connect to a call when you answer or the other party can‚Äôt hear you very well. Sometimes they work perfectly but 8/10x they give me trouble when I try to use them to talk on the phone. Battery lasts a long time but other than that they are great headphones
Earpods,mistis8,4,2023-03-09,"Enjoyed was nice loud good volume easy to connect to phone and easy to find with phone , quality all together was well , wish came in other colors"
Good,jessecap1,4,2023-03-09,Used this for my AirPods. Seems to work just fine and overall pleased with the product and purchasing this item for iPhone
It‚Äôs pretty good sound quality,ariana4president,3,2023-03-09,It‚Äôs pretty good sound quality for new users especially for people who work in loud environments. I think this is the best thing you can have especially if you are use to apple
I thought they were stupid,hibaadagher,4,2023-03-08,"but they‚Äôre so helpful! especially when exercising or walking. I like them especially for cleaning / tidying up around the house, because I‚Äôm not worried about my hands getting all tangled up."
I need another pair because I didn‚Äôt receive mine,Mia,1,2023-03-08,There is nothing in the case but the charger can I get another because I need got the AirPods or the case just the charger and box
I like them!,ginal106,4,2023-03-08,"I love the charging case, I don‚Äôt like how they pop out my ears. But they are loud and super convenient especially when traveling or working out. I definitely would recommend."

Very convenient,huongn18,4,2023-03-08,Very convenient you can listen to music. Talk on the phone and a sound is very clearÔøº and you can carry any where you want it connect on every device like it
Good enough but gets dirty,onlyphams,4,2023-03-08,The sound quality is fine. I find that they aren‚Äôt super secure for running. I hate how dirty the case and AirPods get. They‚Äôre hard to clean. I like the ease of connecting to my iPhone which is why I have them.
Pretty good for the price,havek,4,2023-03-08,"Airpods second generation is wireless Bluetooth earbuds designed by Apple inc. They are white wireless earbuds that come inside a case that uses Bluetooth from your phone. You can watch videos, listen to music, or even hear anything that comes from your phone. They know when theyre inserted in your ear and are ready to work as soon as you put them in, and additionally, theyll pause audio automatically when you remove them. The product is really easy to use. All you have to do is put them in your ear, go to your setting and connect them to your phone, and play whatever you like from your phone.I have had this product for 2 years now and I still love them even though they come out with new ones almost every year or 2. My experience with AirPods has been great. I havent ever had a problem with my AirPods. I feel like the second generation is enough for me because all the generations work the same, they just get better and louder, and since I have had them for so long I think its time for me to upgrade and get new ones. Everybody I know uses this product, and they love them. Airpods are really popular in the teenage world, almost every teenager has a pair of AirPods, and loves them.Air pods sound fantastic for their size, and the battery life for the AirPods alone are great for their size, the charging case battery life is actually 10 times better than the AirPods battery life to me the charging case stays charged longer than the actual AirPods. Airpods have an amazing microphone, you can talk to Siri through AirPods, and make phone calls, and have amazing sound. They dont only connect from your iPhone but they can connect from your iPad, or Apple watch as well, which is great for when you dont have your phone but still want to listen to music.There are not many cons with AirPods, but there are a few. Air pods are really tiny, but that doesnt affect the sound in any way, it only affects if it will stay in your ear for so long, or if they dont fit your ear."
Easily lost,gg3742,3,2023-03-08,Work just fine but easily lost and fall out of ears easily. I wear mine for travel and they‚Äôll become loose and fall out. Not great for an unorganized person ;)

Uncomfortable in ears,christiegioo,3,2023-03-07,"I was very excited to get these new AirPods and try them on, but when I did, I found that they were very uncomfortable in my ears. The sound is great, but it still does not compare to the beats headphone sound."
Portable,jesust8,4,2023-03-07,"I love these AirPods, they are super compact and last a good while. The best feature is that you can use one at a time and they are portable. They charge fast too."
Just okay,syreetat1,2,2023-03-07,"These worked okay for a year but then after about a year the sound quality changed and you could barely hear out of them. After researcher, this is apparently a known issue with the AirPods because they don‚Äôt have the ear bud cover sold on the AirPods Pro."
Great sound,,4,2023-03-07,Easy to use and connect to phone. The sound is great and it‚Äôs compact in size so easy to take anywhere! The charge last a while which makes it great to grab and go.

Kinda mid,christopher,4,2023-03-06,These air pods are pretty mid you can‚Äôt really pause the song just by you touching it like in the gen 3 it‚Äôs alright I guess.
Reliable,abbic15,4,2023-03-05,They have a good sound quality and longevity. They ultimately keep me very focused on the desired task that I am trying to fulfill and they are also very durable.
Go to Apple Store,Nolimit,1,2023-03-05,They worked great until the case stopped charging both headphones I only had them for 10 days

I like them!,purple_t0fu,4,2023-03-05,"I prefer this model to the newer one. I find this version much more comfortable, however everyone I know seems to feel the opposite. They say they hurt their ears (so I might be a ‚Äúspecial case‚Äù)"
Not bad,lisag214,4,2023-03-05,These are not that bad‚Ä¶ it charges very fast but after a while it goes out! Well I‚Äôve had mine for over 3yrs and 1 yr later it started to give problems! It‚Äôs still charging though so that‚Äôs a good sign!
Good but,tiffanit1,4,2023-03-05,"I really like AirPods and the comfort of them, but I do find that the volume is not as loud as wired headphones which is annoying. Otherwise I don‚Äôt mind them at all."

Good,vanessaelli,3,2023-03-03,"It‚Äôs good, to begin with. These are my first wireless earbuds, and I like that because they don‚Äôt get in the way as the cord does. I like how I can just put one earbud in, and they charge up fast. You have to be careful with these because they can be easily lost."
,WalmartCustomer,3,2023-03-03,sorry would not charge

Useful,juliab415,4,2023-03-03,I have been using these AirPods for years and they‚Äôre still fully functional. Only downside is that they will easily fall out if you move your head quickly like in some dance workouts.
Great headphone,jessicac1230,4,2023-03-02,Love my airpods! They are great for when your on the go. I love that they don‚Äôt have wires so they dont get tangled or in your way. I do wish they could be a little bit louder!!
They got a great sound,bellf1,3,2023-03-01,Sound is great but they don‚Äôt stay in your ear. I had lost one and couldn‚Äôt find it.Other then that there good. I wouldn‚Äôt get them again tho. I‚Äôd go with beats.
Great sound quality,nawaalloves,4,2023-03-01,"I use these for personal music listening and also use them at work in a fast paced customer support role. I will say it doesn‚Äôt completely noise cancel, as sometimes the sound isn‚Äôt clear in the busy work environment, but otherwise‚Äî the sound quality is clean snd crisp and the shape is comfortable in the ears. It doesn‚Äôt have much extra bass, but overall the has enough for music to sound rich still. Overall really enjoy my AirPods!"
Easy to lose,wassonhailee,4,2023-03-01,"I love my AirPods, but they get very damaged easily, and are so easy to lose. The charging case can get wet and will not charge anymore. Be very careful with your AirPods, and definitely invest in a case. Ôøº"

,Yefiny,1,2023-03-01,A waste of money. After a couple of months people couldn‚Äôt hear me when using them for phone calls.
The sound quality is bettee than other brands.,tamc8,4,2023-02-28,"I really like these AirPods for various things. I find that these fit my ear really nicely and they are way more comfortable than the AirPod Pros. The only negative thing for me is that sometimes they fall out of my ears when I'm working out, specifically running."
,Danyel,1,2023-02-28,They don‚Äôt always connect. Stop reading the text messages also 1 working other is not!!! Please don‚Äôt buy !!! This is my 3rd pair
,WalmartCustomer,5,2023-02-28,Ordered apple AirPods first gen while on sale . Have ordered before an absolutely love the product itself.
,Samantha,2,2023-02-27,I did not like that the package was on top of wall. Should have been inside the gate by the front door. Delivery says leave at door not on top of wall.
Okay‚Ä¶,mickeydee05,3,2023-02-27,"The AirPods were very good at first. The sound was excellent and they were very easy to connect to my phone. But now, the sound is terrible. I can barely hear things out of them. I‚Äôve had them for about 3 years so that might be why"
Good,nomiob,3,2023-02-26,"Well AirPod is good for first 1 year or so,. Afterwards the battery won‚Äôt last long and always having a issue with Bluetooth connection. However, most convenient product to use from apple"
Airpods,,4,2023-02-26,"I enjoy having this product for standby. The battery lasts long, I wish the sound was louder though. Convenient for workouts and walks. Fits well in ears."
Great Price for Great Product,Makala,5,2023-02-26,This was an unbelievable price for $99. I paid $249 for my last 2 purchases of this at Apple. It came quick and work great!!
Good enough,lauraa536,3,2023-02-26,"I like them! They are perfect for a day or just a few minutes, the battery last for a week so I don‚Äôt have to be worried very often about plugging them in. They don‚Äôt ring in ‚Äúfind my‚Äù which could be very useful. And the quality of sound is not the best. But they are ok."

Good sound,Brett,5,2023-02-25,Girlfriend hates the gummy insert on most headphones so the ‚Äúin‚Äù ear style of these are perfect. Connecting to her iPhone was as easy as opening the case next to the phone and it did the rest itself. Ordered fairly early in the morning and got them same day. Brand new and in the cellophane wrapping. No complaints so far.
,WalmartCustomer,1,2023-02-25,Never received item
it‚Äôs apple,ashleyvee,4,2023-02-25,"I love my AirPods not so easy to lose those like the third pair I bought, but that maybe that‚Äôs just a mean thing but I love AirPods I wouldn‚Äôt I don‚Äôt like the beats"
They are good for the most part besides sound leak,luciuss2,4,2023-02-25,"I personally used these for a few years before my dog ate them but I enjoyed them and they were very good and never hurt my ears, my one complaint would be that after a while the sound started playing like a speaker and not headphones"
Love it!,Karla,5,2023-02-25,"Love that the price drop, after I ordered Walmart delivered next day! I love those AirPods too the sound so good but the only bad thing is the last 4 hours. But is good quality and they last long time due my old ones I give it to my daughter"
I like it,lanat27,4,2023-02-25,I have no problems with these. The only thing I don't like is that sometimes other people can hear the music when I have them on. I would like to listen to my music at max volume without other people being able to hear it.
Decent product,nicoleg611,3,2023-02-25,"They do their job. They are a pain to keep track of and do hurt my ears a bit, but they charge quickly and they are good quality as with all Apple products"
Would recommend,laynasmom17,4,2023-02-25,These are nice in that they charge quickly and are compact to carry. The sound quality is great. Easy to use and easy to integrate with my current tech products. Would recommend.
Dont buy,ricky,1,2023-02-24,recieved a used product and could not get a refun. don‚Äôt recommend
Best Buy for $99,Juanita,5,2023-02-24,i brought them for my daughter and she just loves them. The sound is awesome and the quality. Great Buy!

Great sound,taylorm481,4,2023-02-24,I absolutely love these headphones. The sound is great and the headphones stay in my ears without falling out. Great for working out because I can move without worry of losing mh headphones.
Airpods are pure junk,Anna,1,2023-02-24,these things are crap!! This is the 4th pair of airpods ive purchased between my 3 kids and every single pair stops working within a few months.
Not worth the money,Janet,1,2023-02-23,Both earpieces do not work at the same time! Is not worth it when trying to workout with one ear piece!
,WalmartCustomer,5,2023-02-23,"I have purchased several pairs of Airpods (gifts, losing them--ugh) and these were by far the least expensive of any retailer"
Mixed,anthonym69,3,2023-02-23,"I know I'm certainly in the minority on this but I just don't really care for airpods. I find them to be uncomfortable, especially for frequent use and even moreso for exercising. They've got a pretty cool, iconic design and the sound quality is decent but there are so many wireless earbuds out there that produce equal or greater sound at a fraction of the price. These certainly are functional and work as intended but I just think that they have been outclassed time and time again."

Incredible and useful!,emmarose19,4,2023-02-22,"I LOVE my airpods and use them literally everyday. They are great for listening to music or simply just to watch stuff on your phone while not wanting to disturb those around you. The sound quality is great, and so is the battery life of not only the case but the airpods themselves. My only problem is they tend to hurt my ears after a little while, and they fall out easily, but everyone‚Äôs ears are different! I love these though, and if you‚Äôre a big music listener, these are a must have Ôøº"
really good but they cut out sometimes,bella,4,2023-02-22,"okay so i am 15 and i had just got paid so i wanted to buy some airpods because i had never had them before.these are real airpods(well my where),i was so scared i had waste my money but they work awesome.but i not sure if it just mine or what but they something cut out for a second, and you cant go that far without thing cut out.but i know it does not sound good but these are really good.i would buy them again.so if you have so money than buy them"
Good not great,michaelh1,3,2023-02-22,"The wire free concept is great, but the use of these as designed is pretty limited. With attachments going running or other strenuous activities aren‚Äôt a problem, but who wants to buy accessories when the point of a product is minimizing attachments? These are good for use while sedentary."
Goodbye wires,cperezp,4,2023-02-22,"Love to go walking with these headphones and not have to deal with the wires anymore. After a couple of years, one of the loses charge faster than the other but they still do their purpose"
do not buy,sandy,1,2023-02-21,they were brand new and the speakers went out and it wont let me return it
"They‚Äôre okay, no pro",xxseggyxx,3,2023-02-21,I thought these were great until I upgraded to the pro version. These don‚Äôt fit comfortably and always fell out of my ears and there‚Äôs no way to adjust. They also constantly disconnected and we‚Äôre very frustrating
Works Well  with IPhone,janaf27,4,2023-02-20,"Works well although wish range was farther. I‚Äôm currently living in a 2500 sq. ft. house and have to keep my phone within closer range than preferred. Also when wearing both ear buds it is noise blocking from exterior sounds, like earplugs. Charge last a few days with intermediate use."
Love,kaydeenc,4,2023-02-20,I love my AirPods. My only qualm is that sometimes they just jump out (not literally) of your ears. And they act weird a little bit sometimes. Like not connecting and syncing when needed.
Great,baileyk56,4,2023-02-20,"I love them because I don‚Äôt have to worry about cords. Sometimes mine take a little long do connect to my phone, but none of my other friends have that problem."
,WalmartCustomer,2,2023-02-20,"Have not received the product even though it was supposed to arrive yesterday. No expected shipping date, so unsure if it's a 1 day, 2 day, or multi-day delay."

5/5,Trinity,5,2023-02-19,I love it so much they are very much real and they do come in a apple box and it comes with everything you would need !

Alright,emilyv202,3,2023-02-18,"I didn‚Äôt really like the apple air pods too much. They made my ears hurt after wearing them too long. The battery didn‚Äôt last as long as others i‚Äôve tried and by the 1/2 year of using the left one just wouldn‚Äôt work anymore. Overall, my experience wasn‚Äôt the best and I wouldn‚Äôt purchase again."

Very disappointing,Jacob,1,2023-02-18,"Great experience for the first 3 months, I loved them. Since then the product quality has rapidly declined. They consistently stop working at 60% battery charge, and have reduced in sound quality consistently. I can use them for about 20 minutes before needing to charge again which makes them essentially useless. I will not be buying AirPods again, due to the price and quality I have experienced."

Handy,brettb14,4,2023-02-17,They‚Äôre very helpful! I enjoy using them to have a hands free conversation or to listen to music as I work on things. I would highly recommend! The only flaw is they can be easy to lose if you‚Äôre not careful.

Convenient,adelez2,4,2023-02-15,These things are great very convenient. What I don‚Äôt like about them is that the sound quality is not so great you don‚Äôt get what you pay for in terms of sound quality and they‚Äôre also very easy to lose

"Charge box wouldn‚Äôt hold charge
wire after 1.5 mth",Famke,1,2023-02-14,"I purchased these in December 2022. They had a return window that closed the 3rd week in January 2023. It‚Äôs now the second week of February 2023 (less than a month after the return window closed), and the charging box will no longer hold the charging cord. It just falls out.. I‚Äôve been an apple user for many years, in fact most of my technology is Apple. I‚Äôve never had this issue! I never before tried the AirPods because of their short battery life, but when I saw the price on ‚Äúsale,‚Äù I decided to go for it. One and half months of usage and they are useless plastic garbage. I‚Äôve always been careful with my technology, and treated these with the same care as the other items I have. Total disappointment. The short battery life was challenging enough, but I could work around it somewhat by only using one at a time. Now..I have no way to charge them. These were not marketed as refurb, so I assume they were new. Now I wonder if they are some kind of fake. I would not recommend these to anyone, and I think Walmart should make this right. I‚Äôve been a long time shopper at Walmart, and I‚Äôm not happy with this loss."

Airpods,jayg43,2,2023-02-12,I‚Äôm disappointed in Apple. I don‚Äôt find their AirPods too comfortable & I expected the volume to be better than it is. I can‚Äôt use these for too long because my ears feel like they‚Äôre bruised
Battery life sucks,Patrick,2,2023-02-12,"These are absolutely NOT the same as the first generation. The battery dies SO much quicker. It‚Äôs sad to say. I wish I hadn‚Äôt lost my original ones. I literally live with these things. It‚Äôs a life saver wrangling two of my disabilities with these. But their battery life is absolutely trash. I honestly wish I could recommend, but sadly I do NOT."

AMAZING,Alvaro,5,2023-02-11,Oldie but feels like brand new
Great clarity and cool functions!,HEATHER,5,2023-02-11,"Very pleased with these. I‚Äôm always years behind on technology and a couple of my favorite things about these is: 1. How they automatically connect(after the initial set up connection of course)when you put them in your ear. 2. I can just wear one if I want and do, so I can hear what‚Äôs going on around me. 3. You can customize each earbud to do a function with a double tap ex. My left one, I can pause/unpause the song I‚Äôm listening to. The right one will skip a song when I double tap it. 4. My hearing isn‚Äôt as good as it should be(I‚Äôm 39) and listening to phone calls on speaker no longer help. I love putting in the earbuds being able to hear!!"
In my opinon,annad370,4,2023-02-11,I think these are durable eve without a case and has every good battery but it does not have noise cancellation which sucks but overall pretty good

Good until it's not,celyb2,4,2023-02-09,Great until they get to be a few years old. They then no longer hold a charge and constantly connect and disconnect from your devices.

Love my Apple Air Pods,Jan,5,2023-02-09,These are basic Apple Air Pods. Nothing fancy. But just what I wanted for my first pair of Air Pods. Yeaa! I‚Äôm done with cords and connectors that aren‚Äôt the right size.
You can‚Äôt go wrong with these.,laura,5,2023-02-09,I think these headphones are awesome. I had the AirPods Pro and they were worthless. These are well worth the price.
Happy with them,sailordior,4,2023-02-07,"Solid headphones. The sounds quality is decent and the noise cancellation is great. My only issue with them is they tend to fall out of the ear from time to time. Other than that, I would recommend if you‚Äôre looking for a new pair of headphones"

Great quality,paigeca6ee,4,2023-02-05,"These aren‚Äôt necessary to have but they are very good. Because of the new I phone update there isn‚Äôt a different spot for the charger and the earphones. So, now with this product you can charge your phone and listen to music at the same time. It is very convenient because you can skip and pause a song without going on your phone to do it. Overall I really like them and they charge lasts a while."

Charging one while using other,melvan1,4,2023-02-05,"I like the fact that while using one AirPod, the other is being charged. When one dies, you have another to use and can charge the other."
I‚Äôd recommend getting the newer versions,nadiam164,3,2023-02-05,"Okay so I‚Äôve had both wires and AirPods. I‚Äôll start off with the pros: they‚Äôre easy to handle, u can easily carry them as they can fit in ur bag etc, and u can use them with ur laptop etc. Now the biggest con I would say is that with this specific model they tend to stop working easily and a few months after using them the right AirPod lost volume. I tried numerous times to fix it but it did not work. Secondly u can lose them quite easily so if you‚Äôre clumsy, u gotta be extra careful. Overall I‚Äôd say GET AIRPODS just to make ur life a little easier, but buy the newer models for ur moneys worth."
The battery is poor.,lauragh,4,2023-02-05,The only thing I didn‚Äôt like is the battery lasts very little and sometimes the Bluetooth was lost because the connection didn‚Äôt catch when you needed it more. I wouldn‚Äôt buy them again.

Mediocre for what cost,stephanies945,3,2023-02-03,"I feel like these were a decent investment.

Much better headphones out there for a better pric,sydneyd105,2,2023-02-02,I had these for a few years but after a little bit the right one stopped working and the sound is very quiet no matter how loud I turn it up.

I eventually ended up getting the jbl earbuds instead and I love them so much more and they‚Äôre only about $40 so much cheaper as well.

Just ok,andreahampton88,4,2023-01-31,"I love how small and easy these are to carry in my bag. However, apple headphones are extremely uncomfortable in my ears and I can only wear them for a short period of time before my ears hurt so bad I have to take them out that‚Äôs just a personal dislike."
Nice,lillayrosee94,4,2023-01-31,They are good head phones but I do prefer my AirPods Pro because these tend to fall out of my ear when I‚Äôm running or even walking to be honest.
Too much overrated,yassinec1,3,2023-01-31,"Idk if this is gonna make sense but people not everything that has an üçé on the back is good, like these AirPods they just feel old and too over expensive I understand most of our products are indeed from apple im not against but I‚Äôm just saying don‚Äôt be obsessed with it they literally are not the first when it comes to high technology and comfort!!"
Love the case & sound,diamondb28,4,2023-01-31,"Great sound quality. Love that I can tap to pause or skip songs. Comfort level not the best, wouldn‚Äôt recommend laying on the side of your head while using."
Apple sucks!,mandyl46,1,2023-01-31,Do not buy these. Sound quality sucks and my daughter's 1 of them stopped working so now no good. Charging case being white gets so dirty..just noooo..

Great Headphones,schwoopnation13,4,2023-01-14,These headphones are great to use with almost anything you use. It‚Äôs easy to switch between any apple product and only a couple clicks away from connecting with non apple devices. It holds a decent charge that I can charge once a day. Sound quality I would give 8/10. Only reason I give it 4/5 stars is because I have issues with keeping it in my ear.

Manufactured failure,Jacob,1,2023-01-13,Worked for 2 months and then became incredibly spotty when used.
You can find the air pods but not the case,kailem,4,2023-01-13,I love the air pods and that you can find them. My only complaint is that you can never find the case if you lose it.
Love my airpods,lianashardiana,4,2023-01-12,The sound quality is pretty average. I love the fact that I can ping them from my phone to find them if they‚Äôre lost. I also like being able to put them in a case to charge them. I do lose them very easily and have already gone through two pairs

Stolen product,Cassie,1,2023-01-09,When I received my package it looked like someone opened up the box and resealed it. When I look inside I had an empty airpods box. Not sure who stole it in the process but either way was very disappointed. Thankfully the return process was easy

These are a must buy for every day!,Erin,5,2023-01-05,I absolutely love my airpods. I had a first generation pair who eventually lost their ability to hold a charge after a few years so I upgrade to the second generation. They are so comfortable to wear and the charging case is so sleek and easy to use.
Take note -,LB,4,2023-01-04,"We had an issue with the first pair - the left earbud didn't work at all. We wanted to exchange, but Walmart would not honor the same price. In spite of this, we ordered a second pair because they still had the best price. Second pair worked fine."
Wire free for me...,Doc,5,2023-01-03,"Excellent BT ear pods for the $$$. While these are a generation older than the airpods 3, they are preferred by many for their smaller shape. They will connect to almost any modern bluetooth transmitter, if you are in Apple's ecosystem the Apple Airpods are the only way to go IMHO."
Perfect for my 11 year old,Abigail,5,2023-01-03,I bought these for my 11 year olds birthday and they have been awesome for her. Perfect size and nice and loud! Keeps a charge for a good while! Will purchase again if needed!

They don't work,DebbyD,1,2023-01-02,These air pods will not connect to my Son's phone nor any of his friends phone. This was one of his bday presents that he has been waiting on since October. (Bday is in Jan)

In-store purchase is probably your best option,Arsenio,1,2022-12-30,"AirPods looked perfect‚Ä¶ Once I connected them, I realized the LEFT AirPod did not function at all. What an adventure this will be I thought. So of course I went to YouTube to see if there was a DIY method to save time. Followed the steps exactly and AGAIN nothing. Continuing my search to find the diagnosis, I learned that this is happening to hundreds of ppl maybe even more. Are they pumping defective products just to make the sale?"

Good but could have had a better price point.,Thomas,4,2022-12-27,Great product but found out days later could have purchased at Best Buy for $25.00 less. I thought WM had the lowest prices period. Not so much anymore.
,Bonnie,1,2022-12-27,walmart did not specify that they where possibly going to semd out refurbished ones and i ordered new so when they where opened in Christmas day they where already used and where programmed with very nasty stuff now needless to say walmart will only return them not replace and i have to go buy another pair at full price . they this is what happens when you buy a hlack friday deal. they are refurbished. so not happy

,Deanna,1,2022-12-24,Bought as a Christmas gift. Daughter opened them and don't work. Won't charge! Was tolf they have no more and all ghey can do is return them for a refund.
,Shannon,1,2022-12-24,"I thought this was a great deal at first , until my daughter opened them the next day and one of them did not work . Initially we thought ok maybe trouble shooting so we called apple support and that didn‚Äôt work . Went to Walmart And they stated the serial numbers did not match , mind you they were brand new in the package, so to be continued."
,Jay,1,2022-12-24,"Very disappointed. The audio level is way too quiet, and it often has the audio disrupted when in a place with a lot of other Bluetooth devices (like the gym). It also has a habit of going out of sync by about .2 seconds so the right one plays just slightly ahead of the left one. The volume is so low that even at max volume I can still hear the music being played at the gym if I am close to the speaker (like when I do cardio). The only positive things I can say about these are that they stay in my ear well and the battery life is good."

Was sold a broken bait,Beth,1,2022-12-13,"The item turned out to be a used returned broken item. I bought these for my daughter an hour before she left to go back to school because she lost her air pods. My daughter charged them before leaving for the airport and in the car. After bording the plane she attempted to connect them to her phone and set them up and found out they were registered to someone else. She was frustrated, but reset them only to find out one did not work. When she arrived back at school, I had her go one step further and check the serial numbers, naturally they did not match the serial number on the box, which I have at home. I'll be returning these when she arrives home next week. Why would a returned item be put back in the drawer to be sold again? Why would an item such as this not have better security for a return (ie: checking serial numbers to make sure it wasn't the bait and switch that this clearly was?"

Great Price....test your airpods,Janis,3,2022-12-06,I love the airpods. The right airpod was not working. I had to exchange the airpod. The new airpods is working fine. Please check your airpods when you receive them. I just bought another pair because it is such a good deal. I will be testing it out and looking to see if they are new. I have been seeing a lot of reviews that the airpods are not new.

So happy with my AirPods,DesiD,5,2022-12-03,Got these AirPods during the Black Friday sale because they were such a good deal and I couldn‚Äôt be happier! They were brand new sealed in the box and paired immediately. The charge lasts a very long time and the time to recharge is so quick. I have smaller ears so I was worried they might fall out but the long stem helps them stay fit. I‚Äôm so happy to have them
,Semba,5,2022-12-03,"I had a problem with my address, it was my fault, I put the wrong number, but the Walmart clerk helped me correct it and I was able to receive my package, it is a gift, so I can know if the product is ok now, but I believe it is ok. Thanks a lot for the help!"

"Great sound, price, excellent integration w iPhone",Tim,5,2022-12-01,"My wife loves them. Great sound, perfect integration with her iphone. Just makes sense for iphone users."
Fall out of ears easily,Blue,3,2022-12-01,"They fall out of my ears if I lay down or bend over. The sound is good and they stay charged well and are easy to put in and take out of case. I don't like that the case doesn't stand up and has to lay down. I think it will be easy to lose them. I already had trouble finding one when I bent over and it fell out, rolling under the couch. They don't seem very practical for someone like me that isn't sitting around all day. I'm using them with an android phone and they don't even show a battery percentage. All of the other Bluetooth devices I've used have shown a battery percentage. I guess it shouldn't be a problem as long as I keep the case charged and put them in the case when I'm not using them."

,LILLIE,5,2022-11-26,I had a time trying to figure out how to turn the volume up/down. On my IPhone you use volume keys. I love the airpods. They fit my ear better than my other ones. Thank goodness.
Came used and opened.,Jordan,1,2022-11-26,"These are supposed to be ‚Äúnew‚Äù airpods. Yeah right. mine came dirty, with an opened box, and they didnt even have the decency to put any bubble wrap in the packaging. I am so angry. I did NOT want to buy used airpods."
Pretty Awesome,Bubca,5,2022-11-26,"I think that the Air pods are awesome! The shipping was a day late, but everything was safe. Would definitely recommend. Great product!"

NO packaging, no bag, nothing to hide/camouflage from porch thieves! Needless to say, my child seen them on the porch so she will be one less Christmas surprise. Very disappointed!!!"

Worth them!,barbara,5,2022-11-25,"They came in a seal box, a brand new one. Love them, nice fit to my ears and the sound is pretty good and at a good price. Love the connectivity and the fasting charge and can be charged wirelessly."
,Carrie,5,2022-11-25,"These came new and sealed, and are official Airpods. I received these directly from my local Walmart and have had no problems with them. They work seamlessly with my iphone SE and are so much better than the cheap knockoffs I had been using. Airpods connect right away after opening the lid, and displays the charge of both the case and each airpod. You can recharge your pods in the case as long as the case itself has a charge. This has been a game-changer for me and I don't have to worry about short battery life of my buds or finding a place to plug them in. Highly recommend upgrading if you've got an iPhone."
,Ashley,3,2022-11-25,"Love that I was able to get a good deal on these for Black Friday, however disappointed that the charging case doesn‚Äôt work properly. AirPods themselves are fantastic, however the charging case doesn‚Äôt wanna charge half the time. In other to ‚Äúreboot‚Äù it back up, I have to put the charging cable in and out just to get it to come back on. And when it does come back on, it will show one AirPod has significantly drained when beforehand it will say something different."
,Eli,2,2022-11-25,This product worked well for about 3 months then over the day the sound quality got lower and lower until I could barely hear. Would not recommend

Battery life sucks!,Dee,1,2022-11-24,Don‚Äôt waste your money on these. They die super quick even when fully charged. They‚Äôll also randomly disconnect from your phone. I charged them overnight
Great and durable,Monzer,4,2022-11-23,"I bought the first one from the apple store, and they were very nice and clean, I just placed my order from Walmart, they would be great to give them as presents"

Apple doesnt homd a charge,theresa,2,2022-11-22,I purchased this in June 22 and in October it stopped working. Wont charge or hold a charge. I hope the warranty will replace it because it really is user friendly

Okay,ashleighh56,3,2022-11-19,"I used to absolutely love my airpods. They are comfortable, sleek looking, and nice sound quality. But, over two years they hardly even work anymore. They cut out all the time and hold a charge for maybe twenty minutes if I am lucky. So, overall they are okay."

Ow,sillykay_kay,1,2022-11-15,Hurt my ears. The sound is good but the build of the air pod itself hurt my ears and made it difficult to use. Didn‚Äôt stay in my ear either

Worst earpods with apparently planned obsolescence,Andy,1,2022-11-13,"Junkiest earpods I've ever used. I didn't like these from the beginning and I should have just returned them, but now they are truly broken 1 day after their warranty. They always cut out when I'm listening to music. I rarely use them nowadays but I just tried to use them yesterday and nothing happened when I opened the case, so I hooked it up to the charger and today it's doing the same thing. I checked the warranty and what a shocker, it expired yesterday. It's okay though, at least I can go back to using my better and 1/10th the price earpods that never drop out. Never buying Apple accessories again."
,Kaykay,5,2022-11-08,They were amazing I know it sounds crazy but they seriously felt and looked brand new they‚Äôre loud and everything i asked for!

Too expensive,Jasper,1,2022-11-06,"I have compared these to many many many other wireless ear phones, and have found that Apple is a rip off up charging $20 ear buds. you can get just as good if not better ear buds, at a dollar store without breaking the bank."

There's a possibility you might get used airpods!!,Ani,2,2022-10-28,"I was so excited thee get these airpods and they came in just a day (the reason for two stars) and when I opened the airpod case, I was disappointed. The airpods had wax on them and was clearly used before. It might've been someone returning their old ones but it was very disappointing. I am going to try and exchange them for the new unused condition airpods I paid for."

Love them more than newer version,Kay,5,2022-10-27,This is my second pair of these and I love them I don‚Äôt get why people spend so much more money on the newer ones. I like the way these fit better
Pretty Nice,Damarion,5,2022-10-25,They came today and I like them already. The good part about this is that the AirPods are real too. They were fresh in the box. They work perfectly fine too. And they weren‚Äôt used at all and were new. They were also clean. I‚Äôm already listening to music.
Great!,hannaht136,4,2022-10-24,These may be overpriced originally but they are great quality. Occasionally they don‚Äôt connect but they last a while when charged.
Save your money for something else,Anonymous,1,2022-10-24,These AirPods were 1 star.I like listening to music while I workout and they kept falling out even when I would just be walking around outside . I constantly had to keep pushing them in while running on the treadmill. I understand that these aren‚Äôt sweat resistant but it was sensitive to the slightest touch of water or sweat and when I tried to clean the outer shell with water ( I avoided touching the speaker and mic) It basically messed up the sound completely . I bought them 2 months ago I can‚Äôt even use them. I like listening to hiphop music and the first thing I noticed when I put them in was that the base was non existent . The wires sounded so much better.

Love them,Jackie,5,2022-10-13,They came charged and clean. There wasn‚Äôt any dents/scratches or any indications that they were previously owned which means they‚Äôre probably new. They were tightly packaged but did come a day late‚Ä¶ I think due to weather though. Overall I love them.

Highly Recommend,sissy,5,2022-09-10,They‚Äôre nice. It came brand new but the only issue I have is I can‚Äôt connect it to my phone. It always says ‚Äúnot your airpods‚Äù but I think that‚Äôs a personal issue. It‚Äôs a great deal if you‚Äôre thinking about buying them do it!

AirPod second generation,C,5,2022-09-06,Absolutely love them I don‚Äôt know why I waited so long to get them they fit perfectly they‚Äôre not uncomfortable and overall not a bad price
,Martin,5,2022-09-03,"Fast delivery was the to buying at Walmart. Yes the price was also good ,, others had the same price but delivery was longer. So you got the sale"

Poor packaging from Walmart,PK,3,2022-09-01,"The airpod was good but the packaging was horrible. There was no box or wrapping, just a plain plastic bag. We were very lucky to find that it wasn't stolen by other people because the packaging made it look like a waste on the street."
Not 2nd gen,Roman,1,2022-08-31,"These aren‚Äôt 2nd Gen, they don‚Äôt have wireless charging. Basically paying the price of the 2nd gen for 1st gen. Definitely getting returned"

Preowned???,TC,2,2022-08-25,These had a name already assigned to them ‚ÄúCarolyn‚Äù when paired. I didn‚Äôt think they were preowned‚Ä¶
Overall good,Lisa,3,2022-08-24,These say they are 2nd generation but they are not they are first generation but other than that they are nice and new

AirPods,SunnySunshine,5,2022-08-06,"These are way more comfortable than I thought they‚Äôd be, more so than the original corded headphones. I‚Äôm not an Apple snob, but Apple devices should only be paired with Apple accessories; life is easier that way."

Not a fan,aubreym41,2,2022-08-03,I dont like these to be honest they work good etc but i feel like they dont stay charged long enough for example if I‚Äôm on a flight and use them for 4 hours to watch tv i have to recharge but if i have wireless cheaper brands (much cheaper) theyll stay charged the whole time
Was Excited but ended up disappointed,Sasha,1,2022-08-02,"I‚Äôve had them for a week, and loved them so much at first. But 4 days in, when I say Hey Siri, she doesn‚Äôt respond. My hands are normally occupied so I rely on this feature. Another issue that started is it starts to lose signal and my phone is in my pocket. The song just starts skipping. Sucks for phone calls, which I do a lot. Been told I sound muffled (even when there‚Äôs not much background noise) so when there is background noise, it can be heard to the max. I hope I can return these"
Great!,alexc210,4,2022-07-31,"Awesome product, me just forgets to charge them so I always run into the fact that they‚Äôre dead. I just keep some wired ones around, but when I do have them, they‚Äôre nice. I do a lot of calisthenics and they stick in my ears for everything!"

Misleading,Angie,4,2022-07-30,"They say 2nd generation when they are actually first generation. it works well and all and my sister loves it, but it is quite misleading"
Trash,janecia,1,2022-07-27,"First it took forever when it was supposed to be 2 day shipping it took almost 2 weeks for me to get them. They worked for a couple of months and now they are super low, and the headphones are always falling out of my ears. I‚Äôm getting AirPods Pro and it won‚Äôt be from Walmart. Sucky experience"
,YAN,1,2022-07-23,This AirPods is broken and can't be used.
Refurbished,Randi,3,2022-07-21,"It doesn‚Äôt connect to the device automatically most of the time, it‚Äôs slow to connect. It seems like the volume is lower than expected."
okay i love you,zachc14,4,2022-07-19,i love you so much too buddy i hope you are having a good day buddy buddy hope you‚Äôre doing well and you will feel good
My first pair,TMB,5,2022-07-18,I really enjoy these they are my first pair! It took me a while to get air pods because I was scared about them falling out but they stay put and it was a great purchase I use them all the time.

Unhappy,Kimmy,3,2022-07-15,The AirPods are 7mos old and having problems with charging. Only one ear piece not charging. Not happy it wasn‚Äôt cheap.
Lasted for a while,Sarah,2,2022-07-10,"I got these as a Christmas gift. About a couple months later, it started to make the same cracking/ popping noises as I've heard some say had the same thing happen to them and started to echo. I knew they would eventually go ka put when it started to do that as some point. Then today, the left side of my air pods stopped working. No sound coming out of it whatsoever. I tried disconnecting and reconnecting it to my laptop and even tried charging it some more. Still no sound. Didn't even last me a year. I will see how much the better one's cost and see if they're better."
Amazing quality and call handling,JayB95,5,2022-07-09,These were actually pretty great I love the fact that it has such amazing sound quality. I watched a movie on Netflix and the sound made it as though I was sitting in a movie theater so overall it is a great product and it does really well with call handling.
Fake product,E,1,2022-07-07,I received a fake pair of AirPod Pros that were very low quality. I only realized when my friend told me and now I don‚Äôt know if I can get my money back or if I wasted $150

The right airpod,Noname,1,2022-07-05,I had this not even a year and my right AirPod stoped working the sound was bad but I could still tap it and it would work just no sound.
Sound good but fall out of ear a lot,Lisa L,4,2022-07-03,They seem to fall out of my ear a lot. But they sound great!!

Good while they lasted.,Dee,3,2022-06-27,"I loved these aipods, but after a few months one of them stopped working."
Think twice,SAM,1,2022-06-26,"I purchased these for my teen daughter. She had to turn the volume up as high as it would go in order to hear, which shouldn‚Äôt be the case. She had to do the same thing to her first AirPods after having them for about a year and a half which is understandable, but not with new ones directly out of the box. Called Apple they suggested sending the AirPods 2 gen to them which I did. Afterward they did some troubleshooting they worked better, but still not like they should have. The First Gen were better in my opinion."

Amazing while they worked!,catchthewavewithsam,4,2022-06-23,"I got the AirPods with Wireless Charging Case around the same time the AirPods Pro were released. They worked great up until recently. The case no longer charges- thus the AirPods never charge. I used my moms case for a while until I had to get a replacement case. While annoying, apple products tend to slowly stop working as the newer products come out- and they just get old. I have the same issue with my MacBook ‚Äúdying‚Äù on me. The only reason I stay loyal to apple is the cross-device connect-ability. Phone to headphones, phone to laptop, all of it, extremely convenient!"

These are nice,judyrdf86,4,2022-06-22,I wish they were nicer on the ears. They can be uncomfortable. They are noise blocking and efficient and easy to use. Recommend 100%

Airpods,alexisn63,3,2022-06-20,I will use the ones I currently have until they give out but will never repurchase. Not worth it in my opinion. I have one airpod that doesn‚Äôt work and I cannot figure the cause.
Very satisfied.,samantha,5,2022-06-16,"It was delivered before time of my loved ones birthday , there perfect condition new.. very satisfied."
DONT BUY,Ericka,1,2022-06-15,DONT NOT BUY. I USUALLY DONT WRITE REVIEWS BUT I SAVED MY MONEY UO FOR THE MICROPHONE NOT TO WORK ON MY AIRPODS. I CANT TALK ON THE PHONE. AND WHEN I MAKE VIDEOS WITH THEM IN YOU CANT HEAR ANYTHING. Very disappointed

Staple,shelbayybayyy,4,2022-06-14,Took my a while to bite the bullet on these and I‚Äôm so glad I did. So convenient to use anywhere. Love the design of the original EarPods so these were perfect for me. I do get glitches that won‚Äôt connect at timesso that‚Äôs a bit frustrating when you‚Äôre in a hurry. My only other gripe is I though I lost these and I hate that find my iPhone only can track this if the case has been opened.
Great product,leannkitkat,4,2022-06-14,The Apple AirPod case is great! I‚Äôve had mine for about a year and it still works and functions great. It holds a charge for a long time leaving my AirPods charged all the time.

Use wired headphones,punahh,2,2022-06-10,I bought these and within a few months the left AirPod stopped working and after about 10 minutes abuse it goes dead I‚Äôd rather just stick to the wire headphones that last year‚Äôs.
Okay,msparkles,4,2022-06-07,"I love the size of it. Small enough to fit anywhere. However, small enough to miss placed them all the time. Would be nice to have a Lanyard of wrist band to keep on. Or attach to purses/ backpacks / gym bags"

Price Match not possible,Sachin,1,2022-06-06,I ordered the Apple AirPods with Charging Case (2nd Generation) for 99.99 once received it was faulty and not working. The same Apple AirPods is now for 118.98. I asked Walmart for price match but they mentioned not in policy.

Good but gets dirty easily,danieller54,4,2022-06-01,"I love the convenience of being able to charge my case while wearing my AirPods. It does get dirty easily and it is hard to clean out, especially in the small crevices"
NOT GENUINE PRODUCT,Jeff M,1,2022-06-01,(This review was collected as part of a promotion.) Turned out not to be legitimate when brought in for inspection.
Could be better,Jay,3,2022-06-01,"Way overpriced for the quality. Not saying the quality is bad, but it is mediocre. They hurt your ears and they have no noise cancellation. If you happen to misplace them, in the Find My app you can locate your airpods, ONLY IF they are out the case, which is not smart in my opinion, because I have lost my airpods multiple times while leaving them in the case. I gave mine away because i had no use for them anymore."
AirPods Changed the Game,jonathani4,4,2022-05-31,AirPods are so cool! They make switching between listening to your favorite music and taking a phone call so easy! Not the best if you‚Äôre an audiophile but can‚Äôt go wrong with AirPods. Overpriced for what you get but that‚Äôs all apple products.
not my favorite fit,brilabaza,4,2022-05-28,These are a perfect wireless earbud for Apple products. My only critique would be the length of the pod and the fit. It doesn‚Äôt grip and easily falls out during strenuous activity. I prefer the Pros.
Ouch!,,1,2022-05-26,These AirPods hurt my ears! They also never stay in them. I can‚Äôt be the only one who feels this way. I wish I would‚Äôve purchased the Pro‚Äôs bc these hurt and never stay put.

Love these,,4,2022-05-19,I love how easy these are to use. They are plenty loud. I never have any issues using these. I love that they stay in my ears well unlike others I‚Äôve tried I‚Äôve always had a hard time getting them to stay in.
"Amazing at first, but finicky",alyssaw122,3,2022-05-19,"I loved my AirPods when I first got them, but after having them for about 6 months, they‚Äôve become pretty finicky. Sometimes they have trouble connecting to my Mac or iPhone, or it‚Äôll randomly only play From one ear and I have to manually reset everything. I just would‚Äôve expected a more seamless experience for the price."

Terrible,Aniah,2,2022-05-14,"Sound quality is terrible, your better off getting the wired ones or buying another brand."
Cheaper quality,Jo,2,2022-05-13,So I don‚Äôt know if it‚Äôs just me but the quality of these AirPods are a bit different from the ones I already own and got from best buy. Feels more flimsy and cheaper. I had to get new ones cause I lost both AirPods and didn‚Äôt feel like paying 69$ for one airpod replacement. But now I feel like a I made a mistake.
could be better,Krissi,3,2022-05-12,They look fine but they won‚Äôt connect to my phone
Not recommended,Fara,1,2022-05-10,The outgoing sound is not quite good and it's not easy to contact the third party
Okay,cafeconjade,4,2022-05-09,"Not the best out there, but they do connect seamlessly and stay connected. They charge rather quickly if you don‚Äôt need them within an hour or so but not full charge like when I use my lightening charger (which also costs more)‚Ä¶No surprise there!"
Recommend,annalisw,4,2022-05-09,"The fit could definitely be better but the sound quality is amazing! They‚Äôre fragile n break easily so if you‚Äôre somewhat clumsy I may steer clear, any little thing will cause these to start malfunctioning."
Good,priscillay3,4,2022-05-08,I like this AirPods. The quality is good and clear when listening to music/ calls. I will recommend this to everyone. Great purchase.
Perfect,gurpreetc,4,2022-05-08,"This case is perfect for the AirPods, I enjoyed having a small and compact case. It‚Äôs nicer to carry this case over the new wider one"

Just a few complaints,karens461,4,2022-05-04,I love my AirPods however they die way to quickly and makes sound distorted sometimes. I love the case and how easy it‚Äôs to charge.
Love my airpods,gottabemel,4,2022-05-03,I love using my AirPods. I can‚Äôt imagine life without them. They‚Äôre so lightweight and perfect for the gym or when you‚Äôre on the go!
Ehhh,kimberlybx,1,2022-05-03,The left air pod stopped working on me literally less than a year of having them and I was upset with it because I spent good money on them

They are okay,makeupgypsy,3,2022-05-03,They do not fit in my ears well so they fall out. They seem to sound okay if I hold them in my ears. Charging case is great!

"Easy to Store in Your Pocket, but Difficult to Keep Clean",ttiminit,3,2022-05-02,I like the size of the case as it fits easily in my pocket and sometimes I even slide it in my tube sock when I‚Äôm walking around but don‚Äôt have pockets or a bag. The only reason I don‚Äôt like the case is that they collect pocket lint very easily and it‚Äôs hard to keep clean. I use a toothpick and fun-tak which works well but not well enough for the harder to reach areas and I have to clean them way too often.
Not worth the money,kupcakeken,3,2022-05-02,You can get the same quality headphones at Amazon . There not noise canceling and they fall often . You will have to clean them often

Airpods,lanel3,4,2022-04-29,For the first ones that they released they were good. Don‚Äôt hold much of a charge for a few years of use though. For the price not a bad buy.
Okay,jumaras1,3,2022-04-27,I honestly bought these because it was so hyped . Once I got them I did enjoy using them but they keep on falling out. !
Issues with case,Elena,1,2022-04-27,"The AirPod case stopped working suddenly, with the light only flickering and not charging."
Nice,nark1,4,2022-04-26,These are great for on the go. I always have them on me and they are perfect for the gym or going on runs so you don‚Äôt deal with wires

BEWARE! they changed the listing to ONLY the case!,diana,2,2022-04-24,"Bought these at Christmas for my husband. they are great! so i wanted to buy a second pair but was shopping around and only added them to my cart for now. came back today and they changed the listing to only the CASE for the same price!!! Had i not seen these and decided to buy them, i would've been VERY upset when i received only an empty case for the same price. BEWARE! Seems awfully sketchy for them to change the listing to only the case."

Nice,shanaen,4,2022-04-17,Charges your headphones pretty fast. It‚Äôs packaging is nice and basic. The charger itself charges fast also and while you are charging your headphones you can put the wireless charger on the apple charger to charge if you your wireless charger doesn‚Äôt have a full charge.

Airpod charging case,shaziak6,2,2022-04-14,The product worked well for almost an year but started causing problems afterwards. It stopped charging the air-pods and kept disconnecting from the iPhone despite many attempts to fix it.
AirPods are AirPods,sarimg51,4,2022-04-14,The reason I took away a star is because they do start to hurt my ears after a bit and they start to fall out a bit when I get sweaty when wearing them while working out. Otherwise work well with no issues so far
Love it!,jesslynj,4,2022-04-13,Love my airpods! I just hope that I bought the noise cancellation one! Because it will help me a lot studying if I bought the airpods pro with noise cancellation feature
Nonsense at best,richard,1,2022-04-13,This EarPods online cost $99.99 and in store cost $124.99. And customer service can not do a price match? I had to order them and come back the next day to pick them up. I find this to make no sense.
Good,mariannlo,4,2022-04-12,"I love my AirPod! They work great and charge very fast, and I like how I can adjust the volume. I will be upgrading soon to the latest version."
Not impressed,keishac15,3,2022-04-12,Don‚Äôt get me wrong the headphones sound great the case is definitely small and compact but they‚Äôre not very comfortable in my ears maybe I should try out the pro version instead
Awesome,kerim18,4,2022-04-11,I love my apple AirPods. I use them when commuting to work or when traveling. Very convenient without the cord getting tangled up.
Stopped charging,amandamay4,3,2022-04-10,"These were great at first, but after a couple of years they won‚Äôt hold a charge. I will charge them overnight for like 10 hours, and the next morning they only hold a charge for 5 minutes and one of the sides goes dead"
,,3,2022-04-10,I bought mine 1.5 years ago. The earphone is fine but it sometimes has a hard time syncing to the phone and I need to go and uncheck the auto detect. Also the mic stopped working on mine relatively early on so now it‚Äôs just purely earphone. Other than that it works fine

,Marisa,2,2022-02-10,"I waited too long to open my package because it was a Christmas gift for my daughter, I wasn't in a hurry. I didn't have any issues with packaging or used products whatsoever, they were brand new and pristine and had good shipping time, so that is the only reason for 2 stars. However, these don't seem to be a legitimate Apple product. If you compare the sound to the actual Apple 2nd Generation Airpods there is a definite difference. They are not bad quality, but I could've saved myself some money and purchased some cheap ones from Amazon. My daughter has used her actual airpods daily since we first purchased them when they first came out. She continues to use them, so she knows how the sound should be. These were just intended as a back up pair to use while the others were charging, and she does use them, I just wish I had spent a little more to know that I actually know that they were Apple. Maybe I got a defective product, I am not sure, but I just don't know that it's worth the risk."

Apple brand does not disappoint !,Colleen,5,2021-12-07,I bought these for my daughter as a Christmas present. I bought them for my other daughter and she loved them! They are the latest trend in headphones for this generation and the Apple brand is the best in terms of quality and design! I started her off with a cheaper brand‚Äôs version to see if she was responsible enough to take care of them before I purchased the Apple brand which is much more expensive. The quality of the Apple brand air pods make them worth every penny! The sound quality is second to none! I highly recommend !!!

Love the air pods,Mary,5,2021-12-02,"I have been wanting to purchase air pods for some time, and now that I have been using them, really like them. Walmart had a great price, which made the purchase even more appealing."
Nice sound,Msplk85,4,2021-12-02,I likes that it stays in my ears and don't hurt like most earbuds.
2nd AirPods,Tia,4,2021-12-01,So far so good but I bought it with good price so it worth
,Kara,5,2021-12-01,The discount price was very helpful.
Waste of money,Emily,1,2021-11-30,The left one doesn‚Äôt work.
Great product and price,Ed,5,2021-11-29,"This has always been a great product and Walmart.com always has the best price on them. I think this is the 5th pair I've bought in 5 years (2 for me, the rest were gifts)."
Better off with the alternatives at this price lvl,Ezekiel,1,2021-11-29,"Biggest downside: too loose. Any facial movement would result in the airpods being loosened. Sound quality is decent, except for the fact that the output levels are low even if you max out the volume on your phone. It‚Äôs just not practical, especially at this price point. There are a lot of better alternatives out there. I guess i just paid for the brand being apple."
Only one airpod worked,Lindsay,1,2021-11-29,Returning. One AirPod does not work. We tried everything as far as troubleshooting.

"Great online ordering, and delivery from Walmart.",Fish,5,2021-11-22,The price of the Apple Airpods was by far the best price. The on-line ordering was very easy! I was kept informed of the status! It arrived via Fed-Ex on time! The Fed Ex driver was not the friendlies!
Didn't fit my ear.,cjhouston,3,2021-11-22,Pairing was simple and sound is good however they would not stay in my ear so I returned them.

"Best price on Apple products for Christmas, Yeah!",Jim,5,2021-11-19,"I'm an Apple fan, and this was a gift for someone else, based on a set of AirPods that I already own and love. That said, getting Apple products at a price better than any other retailer is what draws me to purchase these AirPods from Walmart."
AirPods Gen 2,,5,2021-11-18,"I got these at the right time since the price has since gone back up to normal. YAY! My daughter has been asking for these for a very long time. They synced very easily and she is extremely pleased with these AirPods II and hopefully she'll get years of usage out of them. The delivery was a day early so that was a plus. They were packaged very well. No rips, dents or stains....new AirPods just as described!"

AirPod Issues,Melinda,1,2021-10-19,"I ordered my AirPods for pick up, got home and used them for maybe half the day and charged them, once I connected back only one side worked, the right side would not connect back to my phone. Took them back and will try another pair soon. But good luck! Reading the reviews I see a lot of ppl have had issues"
,ruthwhatever_,3,2021-10-17,"This review is strictly for the case! I HATE that you can‚Äôt track it if you lose it. I about lost my mind after thinking I lost the case and having to sit in a 3 hour lecture wondering if someone stole it only to find it in my car the next morning, no thanks to the Find My app ü•≤ Otherwise charges AirPods super fast. Like 45 minutes fast. Sleek design. Fits in any and every purse or bag. Love the minimalist design. I like the color change light feature that tells you about the charging/battery status."
"left side stopped working, not worth the buy",Cyd,2,2021-10-16,"It is currently October and I bought these in July. The right side air pod completely died, does not work whatsoever.

PERFECT!!!,Ben Dover,5,2021-09-17,These are extremely useful and they stay in your ear perfectly (my ears don‚Äôt usually fit normal earbuds) the sound is a little quieter that i like but they are still really good for the price. I thought they were gonna be a little over hyped but to my surprise i actually like them a lot! I love how they connect almost immediately. I would definitely recommend!

Great but only lasted 9 months.,Kori,2,2021-08-23,"Great but only lasted 9 months. I purchased during Black Friday 2020. They worked perfectly until August 2021. Even after the AirPods have been in the charging case for 72 hours, either the right or left ear isn‚Äôt fully charged while the other one is at 100%. AirPods are maybe used 5 - 6 days a week, for no longer than 60 - 120 minutes during a workout. Hasn‚Äôt even been a year. Not sure if these are knockoffs or just a bad batch, but I‚Äôve seen other reviews saying one earbud or the other doesn‚Äôt fully charge after being in the charging case for half a day. A shame as these aren‚Äôt cheap, even having purchased on Black Friday."
Great product to have,Shaena,5,2021-08-22,I love my AirPod they stay charged for good amount of time! I workout with them on! They try to slip out when I‚Äôm sweating too much but I just push them back in. I would definitely recommend overall

Waste of money,Elizabeth,1,2021-08-15,They die off quickly. When you first buy the AirPods they‚Äôre great. Then a few months after the AirPods will start to lose sound either in one of the pods or both. I went through two pairs and the same thing happened to both. So I‚Äôll never purchase AirPods again.
,Kip,5,2021-08-15,I had been buying the cheap $20 models for years and finally got frustrated with their short lifespan. I broke down and got the Apple model and have not been disappointed. No problems pairing ... battery lasts a long time. They‚Äôre worth the price.
,sandria1,2,2021-08-13,I like my airpods but currently they have been dead for a whole week. I just hate the fact you need to keep charging it and I barely got Time in my day to charge my phone.

Apple does it again,msfixit,5,2021-07-25,I just received these from Fedex and I did sign for them(good looking out Walmart) the box was unopened(not sure why others were reporting different???) was able to flawlessly connect said AirPods to my iPhone 8-gave my percentages for the wired charging case and the pods themselves which is really good IMO. So sound wise-very crystal clear and the pods picked up on the base part of my songs that are on my YouTube music playlist. Highly recommended for yourself as per the usual

Great I recommend this item,Jayden,4,2021-07-18,I have had this item for a little while. Works very well and very good quality. This item is very good battery life if they die stick them on the charger for 15 minutes and you have about three hours of listening time battery life is great really recommend this product the only thing I dislike is the packaging every time you close it dust get stuck in there and it makes your AirPods have those dust pockets on the edge but they also has very good battery life if they die stick them on the charger for 15 minutes and you have about three hours of listening time battery life is great really recommend this product the only thing I dislike AirPods have dust pockets on the edge thats the only thing I would say is is not great about this item but this item is four stars. Worth the price
Love the long-lasting charge!,Chris,5,2021-07-15,"Very happy with my purchase. The AirPods hold a charge for hours, and even though they have a wired charger, it holds a charge for hours as well. You can talk on the phone or listen to audiobooks while you charge your phone in another room."

Buyer Beware!,MF,1,2021-07-14,The Airpods were used and resold. The right Airpod's microphone didn't work.
,Shannon,5,2021-07-14,They are good for when u wanna be on your phone playing a game or searching something and also on a phone call that doesnt have to be on speaker
Get fake ones,Tommy,1,2021-07-13,Fake ones are better dont get these I got them and the case gets dirty they die quickly and they aren‚Äôt even water proof for $130! that sucks dont get thee buy fake ones and save $100
,giuseppel,4,2021-07-12,I bought these last year when we all had to start quarantining at home. I was impressed with the quality and sound. But I did notice that they would fall out of my ear a lot when I was moving. I would constantly have to push them back in. I know this is something that not everyone experiences but I have read about it online. Not all ears are made the same. I have them 4 stars because I can‚Äôt blame them for the quality and sound. But I can blame them for thinking it‚Äôs one size fits all on ears. (I upgraded to air pod pros) Apple Wireless Charging Case For Airpods

Suspect Not Genuine Apple,Logan,1,2021-07-11,"Second time purchasing from Walmart these AirPods. Second time suspecting that they aren‚Äôt genuine. They look legit and sound good but the connection is flaky and the charging case lid is floppy. So yes they work, but they are definitely IMO cheaper versions of the real Apple AirPods at best."
,Yolanda,3,2021-07-08,It keeps falling from my ear.
Love them,Nicole,5,2021-07-07,"I bought a two pairs, one for me and one for my boyfriend for Christmas because they were on sale for $99 and we both always wanted a pair and we both love them they work great and came in great condition."
Wish it holds a longer charge,Yudiyu,3,2021-07-04,"Great AirPods, works well with my iPhone 11. The only downside of the AirPods is the playtime is very short, I have to charge them up after 3 hours of listening to music."

Worth the money!,Gina,5,2021-06-28,"Easy to charge, easy to connect and easy to use! I've tried the knockoffs and they just do not compare to the real thing. Well worth the money especially when on sale. Arrived overnight too!"
Not worth the price!!!,Isaiah,2,2021-06-27,The sound quality was very bad. Compared to other headphones that I have used for much less. My ear would start to hurt after having them in for more then 30 minutes. I would suggest to not workout in these. They fell out of my ear a lot and as soon as sweat gets in them they fall out.

Disappointed,OldGuy,3,2021-06-24,"So I was going to wait til the Gen 3's came out as they are supposed to have the ear cones but I didn't. I was using $30 TOZ0 T12's but since I switched to an iPhone thought I'd try these. Honestly a little disappointed. The lack of volume and the amount of outside noise that gets through make them worthless to use when mowing. My TOZO's are louder and with the ear cones, I do not hear the sounds of the mower coming through. The sound quality is good, the volume sucks. If used in a quiet environment they are not bad. That and the fact you cannot control the volume with them. I'll stick with the cheap ones when I am mowing. Maybe give these to my son and wait for the 3's."
Yolo,Aaliyah,5,2021-06-22,This is way better than wired earbuds! You dont have to worry abt tripping or the tangledness! Plus the shipping was super fast!
Accessories,,5,2021-06-21,US cellular had a great price and shipped the EarPods quickly. All the associates were very helpful.

AIRPODS,LaShinda,4,2021-06-16,I Like the style and the look. The only thing that I would have to say that I don't like would be the left airpod tends to get uncomfortable after being in my ear for so long. The airpods themselves doesn't stay charged more than 3 hours at a time.

,Suzette,1,2021-06-13,One of them never work unfortunately I misplaced the receipt
Theyre cool,Trinity,4,2021-06-13,Has issues staying connected to my phone. Like if you have both AirPods in and you take ONE out .. it fully disconnects and it takes a hot minute to reconnect
Expected more from Apple like louder,Trisha,4,2021-06-11,Works well.sound could be a bit louder good batter life..itd be easier to use if they made it with the button in the front.buttin should also be a different color.

Nice Product,MotleyCrue,5,2021-06-04,"My only complaint is the elimination of volume control as compared with the wired ones. The wire was a major pain so I guess it's a fair trade off. Other than that, I'm a happy camper."

Uncomfortable to wear,CyndieD,4,2021-05-19,"I love that they have a charging case which makes it convenient. The clarity of listening to music or taking phone calls is wonderful as is my voice when talking. So, I‚Äôm told. The reason for the 4 stars is because they are very uncomfortable to wear and the charge doesn‚Äôt seem to last as long as I was hoping. I wish it would send an alert to my phone when the charge is low. Cyndie"
Convenient,Flor,5,2021-05-19,"Bought these because yes I wanted air pods but, they are incredibly convenient. When I‚Äôm driving I can put them on and take any call or even respond to text messages without having to touch my phone. Once you open the case your iPhone and headphones connect automatically. The battery lasts pretty long too. You can still hear background noise sometimes when the volume is low enough but these are not noise cancelling so it doesn‚Äôt matter. They do the job."

,sashak1,4,2021-05-09,"Apple AirPods second generation works perfectly in my ears. The AirPods were easy to set up, it paired up well with my iPhone 7 Plus. On my iPhone, I could see the battery life in green to know how much power is in my AirPods and the case itself. When it is charging It shows a clear lighting sign so I don‚Äôt have to constantly plug in and charge. The AirPods can charge in the case. I listened with the AirPods indoors and outdoors . The charger and AirPods are lightweight plus it does not take up much space in my bag. My AirPods only takes a few minutes or an hour to charge. The AirPods last a long time when I listen to my music. The only downside is that sometimes the AirPods falls out of my ears. I had to buy a silicone grip for my ears to stay on. However the sound quality is great. I highly recommend Apple AirPods to everyone!"

Paired with iphone xs max,Robert,4,2021-05-06,Airpods are ok. The good thing is they don‚Äôt fall out. Bad thing is they constantly disconnect if you have phone in pants pocket.

Can‚Äôt hold a phone call with them.,Sunshinejo,2,2021-05-06,"I had received the AirPods as a birthday gift. I was so excited and the sound was excellent! However, the excitement quickly faded as I was trying to have a conversation using them. My call kept bouncing from the AirPods, to my telephone, and once to my Apple Watch. I couldn‚Äôt resolve the issue so we return them and exchange them for another pair. Once again, I could not hold a telephone call while using them. I‚Äôm going to return these as I‚Äôm extremely unhappy."

Advertised that it would arrive on Thursday....perfect! Right up until that day, all notices still showed a Thursday delivery. Suddenly on Thursday, delivery was changed to Saturday. VERY disappointed! I had no gift to give on the actual birthday. I won't trust Walmart, again, to deliver when they tell you they will."

The second I open them near my phone it pops right up and connects! I love that it tells me how charged the ear buds and the charger itself is- super convenient! I ended up ordering a cheap silicone case to keep these in good shape, Ive read other reviews sahing the outer case tends to get scratched and Id like to avoid that. The price was great and I caught these on sale - the sale promotion allows me to have funds to insure it for future issues. These are excellent quality and comfortable. Walmart was right on top of things with shipping as well! If you were considering getting these just do it !"

Good value,NLS,5,2021-04-08,Resisted getting these for years but both my son and I got these and are happy. We preferred getting the older version due to the classic ear shape and price.
,kayla,5,2021-04-07,Perfect! Airpods came on time and they‚Äôre still going strong after owning them for about 6 months now. They‚Äôre amazing
AirPods are great!,carl,5,2021-04-06,The AirPods are great for someone who has a lot to do but likes to listen to music and take a call as well.
Sirpods,Amy,5,2021-04-04,I own a pair and these wear purchased to replace the pair my son lost. We all love the the fit quality and sound of the airpods

Best place to purchase the original product.,Kay,5,2021-04-04,"I bought airpods from other places before but every-time some default comes up and i get to return. These ones are original original and works excellent, the way it is supposed to work."
Great for smaller ears!,Jamie,5,2021-04-02,"These are my favorite air pods, as they fit in my ears better than the airpod pros do! This is my second pair that I've purchased. I always gravitate towards Apple products, and use them everyday!"

These are defective,chris,1,2021-04-02,Battery only last 2 hrs. Returning these.
Very satisfied,Cheryl,5,2021-04-01,"Always wanted a pair and I was gonna buy cheaper ones but decided to go with these, and I love them I can hear very clearly."
,Bryanna,5,2021-03-31,"I have a samsung phone, but the earbuds that come with them area shape that never has fit into my ears properly so I bought the apple ones with this shape. Although it doesn't have full function (read aloud messages, skip songs) with my phone, it is a great alternative as the sound quality and shape is great."
Great for working out.,Tess,5,2021-03-31,"These AirPods are great, good price. They work perfectly. I especially love them while working out, no cords bouncing around. And they stay in your ear!! Walmart had a great warranty."
Never stay in my ears,CharmingFancy,1,2021-03-31,"These are always falling out of my ears. Then they don‚Äôt work if one is not in close proximity to the other. Of course they have to fall in a crack where they can‚Äôt be reached rendering them unusable, especially if riding in a car on a long trip. Have to wait for the next stop to see if they can be dug out of the black hole in the car where they fell into. Good thing I still have a phone that takes the wired headphones. I do not like these AirPods. They do have a good sound hence 1 star."
Love My AirPods!!!,Eric,5,2021-03-29,Great price and free overnight shipping. What more could you ask for? The quality of the AirPods is superb. Can‚Äôt go wrong with a product like this.

,Tyqwaun,5,2021-03-28,I love the product the only problem is that they took five days when Walmart told me they would come in two.
Late Delivery,Jacob,3,2021-03-27,I rate it only 3 stars because it came a day late but I recommend these headphones because they‚Äôre good for everyday life.
Best option to buy,Liss,5,2021-03-26,Works perfect! Its a better price too. Apple website is so expensive and here at Walmart its a bit pricey too but at a wayyy reasonable cost! These AirPods work really great 10/10.
Great experience!,Arpy,5,2021-03-26,The airpods work great. Its been more than 4 months since i bought them. I‚Äôve dropped them on hard surfaces many times still they work really great. Happy to have this item.
Great Price,LaShonda,5,2021-03-26,I like how easy they are to connect. For small ear canals I would recommend getting ear hooks to keep from losing them. I love them and the price is great

Love these but...,Brianne,4,2021-03-25,I love these. The sound is great as well as connectivity. The only issue I had was they would fall out of my ears and mad me nervous to wear outside. Wearing mask helped. So I purchased hook covers fir them and now they wear wonderful.
Best Investment for Your Ears,Muneca,5,2021-03-25,I was rather spectacle about buying such expensive blue tooth‚Äôs but I purchased one for my teenager for his birthday and fell in love with the quality of it all. The music doesn‚Äôt hurt your ears like cheap headphones or blue tooth‚Äôs. They last long and they are just amazing. Best thing I ever did was buy a pair for myself the music sounds absolutely amazing. You won‚Äôt regret it.
,Diamond,4,2021-03-24,The charging case goes dead really quickly
10/10,Wendy,5,2021-03-24,"They work amazing, I would definitely recommend if you don‚Äôt like wires make everything so much easier."
One word awesome!,Gustavo,5,2021-03-24,Like I said in the other review I just tried to send really happy with your service love shopping with you way better than Amazon.

,Norma,5,2021-03-23,Really good small so easy to connect to phone really good for listening to what ever you want really handy when going to work.
,Shantell,5,2021-03-21,Really good AirPods. They were packaged just like they was supposed to be. Everything was great I highly recommend!!
Great,Paul,5,2021-03-20,Convenient not having cord of regular earphones. Regular earphone eventually break at gym because they get pulled out of ear by equipment. Unfortunately my gyms treadmill dont have Bluetooth so I have to bring both sets of earphones
Great buy but.....,DaDuchess,4,2021-03-19,The AirPods sound and range was great but the fit was not to my liking. The one size fit all ear piece didnt fit my ear and next thing you know I am picking the AirPod off the floor. Should not have to spend extra to get a good fit for your ears. Exchangeable earpieces should be standard for all AirPods. I gave them to my daughter.
,Moranda,1,2021-03-19,It said my package would be here in 2 days and is now going on 4.
,scoutsofamerica,3,2021-03-18,I love using these at the gym because they don‚Äôt get tangled around me and I don‚Äôt have to keep my phone in my pocket so a cord will reach. Cons are that they‚Äôre so easy to lose and that they can start to sound muffled after a while or usage.
,Evelyn,5,2021-03-17,"I bought imitation first and then it , the genuine apple AirPods and the difference is amazing! I very very happy !"
Poor Battery Life,Steven,3,2021-03-17,Day 2 of having these and I‚Äôm disappointed! I bought them for work purposes to actually last throughout my 8hr work day and they die 4 hours into my shift. Although the case stays fully charged I feel that I shouldn‚Äôt have to recharge my AirPods in just 4 hours. Definitely a disappointment and I‚Äôm going to return these to get the Upgraded version. Hopefully those last longer
,Apple,5,2021-03-15,I like that they are easy to use and have good sound... you have to be careful not to let them slip out but they are a comfortable fit. I like them 10x more than the old headphones.
Worth the money. Get what you buy. Excellent!!!,Justin,5,2021-03-15,"It's the best headphone you could get for yourselves. Perfect sound. And Its battery lasts up to 5 hours, and the volume is fabulous."

Terrible,Skyla,1,2021-03-13,Terrible. Came water damage can barley hear out of the left one.
Love the wireless part,Cherlp,5,2021-03-12,Second time buying this because my first one got stolen. Its the wireless for me tbh. It‚Äôs so easy to use. The only con about this you can easily lose it. I wish apple created a better way to track this device after all its 100 I‚Äôm spending for these headphones. I like the prices here and it‚Äôs affordable here than on apple website.

DOA,Gabriel,1,2021-03-11,"Got it. Had to return it immediately . Wouldn‚Äôt connect the left ear. Don‚Äôt know if it was my phone or the product. Either way, I‚Äôd much rather buy something more reliable"

Horrible,Denis,1,2021-03-11,Horrible. Already lost 2 pairs. The only reason I have them because my company requires me to have them since I develop software
,jonathons2,4,2021-03-09,"I love my AirPods using them for every occasion of my day. My favorite part is the easy and seamless connection to my phone or computer. Other headphones üéß take multiple steps to connect, AirPods automatically connect. The only reason I give 4 stars is when running, I feel like they will fall out. They never do but do not feel 100% secure."
Correct,Terrance,1,2021-03-09,Always ask if anything you buy is it new or used i purchase a Apple Watch 4 from Walmart online for 250 and it was from another seller and it was use and had scratches on the screen
great item,morgan,4,2021-03-08,i love them they are great and do a lot of things so convenient however was not delivered next day

Good,Mariana,4,2021-03-06,Everything was fine. It came in its original package unopened. The only thing was that the left earbud had a tiny scratch on it as if someone had poked it.
,Igitha,1,2021-03-05,This was a deal however after 2 months and no warranty these now are not working properly they can go on the pile with the others I have
,Jacqueline,5,2021-03-04,"these were perfect the only thing that worried me was that I was supposed to pick them up at the store but they came delivered to my home thank goodness I was home, lots of theft going around during the holidyas."
A  Rating.,Slawre,5,2021-03-02,I love these Apple ear pods. They satisfy my listening needs. I use them every day. They charge quickly either by plugging in or setting up next to my Apple cell.

Best gift ever to 9 and 11 year old.,Jcruz,5,2021-02-27,"I purchased 2, one for my 9 yo and another for my 11 yo, after dealing with cheap off brand, and not using them; I decided they like anything apple, sure enough they use them, car rides are much better now!"
Do not buy!,Krista,2,2021-02-27,"AirPods were purchased as a Christmas gift. They worked great for 2 months. At the end of February, only 1 AirPod was working. Problem would not correct itself, and they would non longer connect to Bluetooth at all. Do not buy from Walmart, as there is some type of issue with this product."
Yes!!,Lauren,5,2021-02-21,"So far so good. Came quick, easy setup! So happy i got them. Super comfortable and stays in place while exercising"

,Bobbie,5,2021-02-16,"After trying numerous different earbuds finally decided to bite the bullet and get the Apple AirPods. Love them!! Exactly what I was looking for. Great sound, stay in place during workouts, stays connected and easy to use. Love them."
"Honestly, don‚Äôt bother",Nunnie,1,2021-02-14,"I bought a pair of these airpods and a week later the wireless charging ones went on sale, so I wanted to return the ones I had for an upgrade. The lady told me they couldn‚Äôt take them back because the serial numbers don‚Äôt match. I don‚Äôt understand how they could sell something like that and not have someone check the serial numbers to avoid situations like this. I can‚Äôt even use my 2 year warranty thing because of this so I spent $20 more for nonsense."
Apple ease of use saved the day!,Peter,5,2021-02-11,My wife gave me AirPods for our anniversary. I eagerly tried them out walking the dog. Kids wanted to come along ... we came upon a huge snowbank made by the plow and proceeded to have a snowball fight. I soon realized one of the AirPods had fallen out ... in the snow. Could not find it. Have owned these for like an hour. We realized we could use Apple‚Äôs FindMy feature and before long we found the AirPod in beeping in the snow. Everything about these is easy and well designed. And they sound great!

Won't Charge,Abdou,1,2021-02-07,"Won't Charge at all, horrible customer service to replace. Better off getting an off brand that's cheaper and had better exchange warranty."
Faulty headphones,Whitney,1,2021-02-05,"It‚Äôs only been 3 months, and the left AirPod is not connecting and not even showing up in my screen!! It‚Äôs not working at all, not even charging!! Ughhhhh i should‚Äôve listened to the reviews"
AirPods,Marcela,2,2021-02-04,I‚Äôve only had them for a month and the battery drains super fast on the charging case. Everything else was good aside from the charging case draining. I loved that the sound is super clear easy to pair with on multiple devices.
Pretty Great,Rebecca,4,2021-02-03,"Very pleased! I‚Äôm someone who is very picky when it comes to sound products. There‚Äôs nothing like listening to your music and being able to completely hear all the little components of each song. These earphones are almost perfect! The sound is pretty amazing, for the price it‚Äôs a little disappointing they‚Äôre not perfect but I am still very happy with my purchase and I would totally buy them again."
Seems legit!,Sumrah,5,2021-02-03,"Super great quality, and I got a great deal that's better than I would have got at any other Apple supplier! They seem legit and they look and work really well. My only negative is that I think the mic is not the best, but I think that's just a general AirPods flaw, not because the Walmart ones are not real. Sometimes when I am making a phone call it is hard for the other person to hear me, but maybe its because I have a lot of hair lol and the mic gets covered, and AirPods aren't the BEST at filtering out background noise. Overall though great purchase!"
Don't get if you don't have seen iPhone,Deb,1,2021-02-02,"Not droid compatible. Volume really low using with Galaxy phone. Apparently, common problem with latest version of airpods if you don't have an iPhone. Wouldn't have spent so much $ had this been clear upfront. This was a gift"
,technically,4,2021-02-01,"Super versatile for work calls, Peloton rides, or just watching videos on YouTube. Minor issues include odd shifts in sound quality when muting/unmuting on a video call and sometimes one ear won‚Äôt play, so you‚Äôll have to take out both AirPods, put them into the case, and take them out again."
Do not buy!!!,Angela,1,2021-02-01,The main speaker in the right earbud stopped working after 1 month. Then the left went out. Now they wont hold a charge for more than 1 hour.

They sound great Bu  the they dont hold a charge,Elliott,5,2021-01-30,I suggest buying the insurance because if you lose one its $75 to replace it but with the protection plan its about $30.

Thief stole my account information,Delicious,1,2021-01-28,My card had been compromised and the thief managed to get these but thank God I caught it before they made off with a Nintendo! I can not stand people that steal. God will have His time with them. They will pay somehow for being dishonest!
very disappointed,MH,1,2021-01-27,I honestly heard so many good things about Apple air pods so I had to get a pair for myself after only owning them for 2 months (barely used them) my left ear pod does not work anymore everytime i put it on the charger it says its fully charged but no sound comes out.
Buy protection plan,Krischelle,5,2021-01-23,"I bought these bad boys and got the protection plan for three years. Man, what a great purchase. One of the pods fell and got crushed by my car .-. I made that claim the same day. They send me a gift card with the money and got myself a new ones. Bought the protection plan again."
Bad experience,Miyata,2,2021-01-21,They kept disconnecting to my iPhone and also they were going in and out.
Best earbuds out there,Jasmine,5,2021-01-21,"After waiting to buy airpods until both of my previous earbuds broke, I can say that it is well worth the money so far. I mainly use them for work as I work at Walmart and they never fall out of my ears the whole shift. I also sort of like the feature where the audio pauses when you take your airpods out because it saves me from having to pause it. They charge pretty quickly too. Id say"
Need to improve on the fit.,keviene,4,2021-01-20,Sound quality is very good But it is not secure in the ears like other brands that I have used. It keep falling out.
Crisp sound. Good battery life,Daisy,5,2021-01-19,Love how this latest model air pods is louder than the original one. Slick feel. Easy to charge. Long battery life.
,hannah,4,2021-01-17,These were a great purchase. But one of my AirPods isn't as loud as the other one...I don't know if all of them are like that or if I got a bad pair but other than that it was great.

These AirPods keep me motivated and productive,Christine,5,2021-01-16,"Buying these Apple Airpods with the charging case was one of the best purchased I‚Äôve ever made. The sound quality of these earphones is amazing! I purchased them because I love listening to music and watching videos online. I think it is really cool that you can leave your phone on the table or even in another room and still be able to listen to music or a podcast without having your phone right next to you. Being able to walk around and listen to things wirelessly has given me so much more freedom to get things done around the house. Not only have these earphones given me more knowledge by being able to listen to audiobooks while cleaning the house, but they‚Äôve also given me the motivation to want to keep multitasking, so I can learn new things and be productive around the house at the same time. I would highly recommend purchasing them."

A lot of hype,Ronchetta,5,2021-01-11,The AirPods actually hurt my ears and put a sore in one ear. Set up was simple. They are easy to lose so buy a carrying case for the holder. The sound is excellent. The battery life sucks.

This is my first time ever having them and the music along with everything else that I can use them for is so much cleaner and clearer than any earbuds Ive ever used. I can never go back to using other earbuds. I gave my other ones away. I love the charging case as well. I would highly recommend this product to everyone.

Just ok,Steph,2,2021-01-09,When they stay in there OK. But they don‚Äôt always stay in. And I will disappointment for the amount of money
,juliam210,4,2021-01-09,I love it just wish they could be lil louder for hearing impaired people. I also wish it was lil easier to fit in my ears one size doesn‚Äôt fit all ears.
Extremely disappointed with Walmart,Peggy,1,2021-01-09,ordered this when Walmart had a deal on them as a gift. They worked for 1 week and then one stopped working. My daughter brought them to a Walmart store in Florida to exchange them but they charged her the full price plus tax for the replacement. They were defective but that did not matter. Extremely upset over this. It is not how I expected Walmart to respond to defective merchandise
Trick!,Json,3,2021-01-08,Definitely NOT the latest model as of 12/25/20. Lied to! Misled! Bamboozled!!

,Wanda,5,2021-01-06,I was nervous at first to buy and give these AirPods as a Christmas present but I am glad I did. The above categories were rated as top notch by the recipient. Maybe one of the best gifts I bought this Christmas!
A gift anyone would enjoy.,Salina,4,2021-01-06,"Christmas gift, very nice. Though when I turn up the volume one pod doesn't adjust as quick as the other. It seems like one of them loses charge quicker. Might exchange if it's a major issue."
,Deborah,5,2021-01-06,Love the fact that it connects automatically. Clarity is great. Shipping was earlier than expected so totally happy.

Excellent quality!,SHAWN,5,2021-01-05,My grandson was delighted to receive these air pods for Christmas. They fit his ears nicely. He never wants to take them off. The sound quality is amazing. Convenient port for charging in the hard case it comes in.
,Mona434,5,2021-01-05,I purchased these as a Xmas gift. Although there is a newer option I like these better due to the smaller ear piece. Wonderful gift!
Charging is a challenge but otherwise! They are ok,TaKazia,5,2021-01-05,I love them! Only thing is that the charging is abit weird cause Ill go to charge em and it wont indicate it until I open and close the case a few times. Or sometimes itll take me turning then off and back on to charge them. Other than that I have zero complaints. Totally worth the money
Highly recommend.,Meghan,5,2021-01-05,"Recently bought a new phone that was made without a 3.5 mm jack. After years of using wired Pods, I decided to upgrade. I couldn't be more pleased. Apple has always had a consistently deep, rich sound and these are no different. My absolute favorite brand and type of headphones. So happy to finally be wireless without sacrificing quality of sound."
One side works,Daviyana,2,2021-01-05,They worked well when I first got them overtime I could only hear out of one ear and it‚Äôs not my fault because I use them with care it might be something wrong with the product

Apple Quality!,ers61,5,2021-01-01,"AirPods are just the quality you would expect from Apple. Even bought my wife a pair because the first pair was so good. The only complaint was Walmart/FedEx shipping was terrible. No replies until I posted on the Walmart Facebook page. Then, and only then, did I discover they were damaged in shipping (yea right). Received 2 days later."

Impossible to read directions but good sound,Nancy,4,2020-12-27,"Like the wireless earbuds, after I figured out how to use them. Terrible directions (- 1 star) and terrible printing- tiny light gray font on glossy white paper. Horribly difficult to see and read. Had to go online for legible directions."

Love my new AirPods... So worth the purchase.,Msac8284,5,2020-12-27,I love these air pods. They were easy to setup and are very comfortable.

Would recommend this to others.

"Bought twice, now buying a 3rd pair",JC,5,2020-12-26,"Though I am not a fan of technology, my daughter insisted these were worth the money. She bought herself a pair. She liked them so well that my husband showed interest in getting a pair to use for work. So I bought him a pair for Christmas. He needs something that will be usable for 8 hours of phone calls daily. My daughter says they wont do that but that they charge very quickly. Fast forward to Christmas morning where my son now shows interest, so guess I'll be buying a third pair! So much for being anti-technology!"

Airpods for a birthday/Christmas gift,Carol,5,2020-12-21,"I had a set of these AirPods and wore them for quite some time, I upgraded to the air pod pros and passed my EarPods to a grandchild. Another grandchild needed AirPods so this was a birthday/Christmas gift for him. Good price, quick delivery. I don't have a problem with the sound, hookup, anything about the earbuds they are just not comfortable in my ears."
Whats up with That‚ÄçÔ∏è?,Antonio,5,2020-12-21,The AirPods I recently bought are awesome and were a great buy at less than 100.00. My only issue is from time to time the frequency or the speaker in the AirPod makes a very irritating sound when people are talking or when Im listening to music or a video. Outside of that their awesome!!!!

,Jennifer,5,2020-12-19,Lead sound and awesome quality
Expensive and not that good,Trang,3,2020-12-19,"So, I bought this airpod 4 months ago. It was okay, not to good. The sound is fine, did not as good as I expect. However, the thing that I REALLY don't like about this product is that: For some reason, everytime I connect it with my HP laptop, it DOES NOT generate any sound after an amount of time (1~2 hours). Worse than that, sometimes the videos that I was watching was slower and stuck. And I found out that if I disconnect the airpod, the videos start worling normally again (?!). Another thing that disapointed me about Airpod, apart from its shocking expense, was that the sensor (don't know if this is the right word). So, as I read from the instruction, the sound should be paused when I touch on the back of the airpod, and change sound if I touch it 2 times (if I'm not mistaken?). Back when I was using Android (Samsung), this NEVER works. And now when I switched to Iphone, I also not works really well. I always have to take my phone out and switch the song by myself, and it is not good as I expected. I like Apple earphone and I have been using it until I switched to Airpod. I had a lot of expectations back then, but I then highly disapointed by the sound quality. It was a little bit better, but not too better. And it is VERY expesive :V The only features that satisfy me is the battery, as I do not to charge a lot. Please Apple, if you somehow read this comment, please be better or at least lower the price for the user sake."

I tried everything I could think of, and the guy at the store tried his best to help and we couldn't get the headphones to connect to my phone. I would buy again nor would I recommend."

Sound is good.  Hard plastic hurts ears.,LisaM,4,2020-12-19,"Sound good using on an Android phone. No way to check battery level without a 3rd party app, and pods are hard plastic which hurts ears after an hour or so... rating 4 stars."
Not latest model,Giordano,1,2020-12-18,"This is not second generation, they said latest Model but is 1st generation. I moved out of the country and I dont know how to return"

Very disappointed,esmeralda,1,2020-12-14,I bought this item during the Black Friday sale and already one of the earphones does not work. Aside from this I originally ordered two pairs and received a huge box with only one item.
Perfect for bigger hands and fingers,Kimberly,5,2020-12-13,Purchased these for my husband who's older and has big hands/fingers.. so being able to tap the outside of AirPod for the features is nicer and easier than the newer AirPods Pro (which I have and love).
DO NOT BUY THIS,Connor,1,2020-12-12,"These are cheap fake airpods that are sold at a ridiculous price. I spent 150$ for airpods that came with scuffs that collect an uncleanable pile of dirt, the main speakers not working, and a loose hinge on the case. If these are real airpods, than I'm Leonardo DiCaprio."
Great wireless for iPad or iPhone.,KRIS,4,2020-12-11,Good earphones for iPad or iPhone. They work great and pair easily. Only drawback is the price but still Walmart is always best price.

Worth the price,JR,4,2020-12-10,"I really enjoy the Siri compatibility, especially the reading you your texts function. The sound is worth the cost (I paid $99 on sale) unfortunately I ended up purchasing the pro versions because of needed something that would fit my ears better."
,Johnae,2,2020-12-10,The headphones are good but my case has stop charging for some reason I don‚Äôt know if it‚Äôs cause I‚Äôm using a charger from Walgreens but I even used an original iPhone charger and it‚Äôs still not charging

A sore ear makes it hard to hear,LittleLady,2,2020-12-10,I guess not everybody has the same size ear opening and for me these airpods made a terrible sore in my right ear and was very painful to wear them and tap to answer the calls because the inside of my ear felt blistered. Very bad experience
CHECK YOUR BOX IMMEDIATELY !,Michael,1,2020-12-10,"I opened the box and there was nothing inside except stuffing paper. Upon closer review it appears the original wrap had been opened and resealed with clear wrap. Just passing this along so you can check your box immediately. Unfortunately, there are thieves out there doing this time of stealing. Good Luck"
Great gift!,Rhonda,5,2020-12-09,This was a gift for my son. He has been bragging on the sound quality and clarity. He says the battery life is long lasting also. The air pods were delivered faster than expected and he loves these.
Worth the time and sound is  awesome!!,Dale,5,2020-12-09,"Not used to using earplugs l, son I had to get used to them in my ears. But once I got past that, they feel and fit fine. Sound is great! And they have a noise canceling feature that is really good! The cost was up there, even with a Black Friday sale, but I am happy I took the chance and bought them. Thank You! :)"

Best earphones,Karina,5,2020-12-07,Bought this for myself and as for my husband. He is super picky and he was so impressed with them. He said they were the best earphones and totally worth the price. They are super comfortable and so easy to set up. We are really enjoying them.
a little disappointed,Ally,2,2020-12-07,"I loved them at first but soon I noticed that one of the airpods constantly falls out of my earand after just four months of owning them, there is reduced hearing in one of the pods. Really disappointed that I can barely hear in one of the pods now, and I have never even dropped them or caused any damage to them. I was told that they don't fall out of your ears but mine often do. Sad :("

Too much,Alexis123000,2,2020-12-03,Stopped working after first week Apple replaced both pods then the case. Now cant sync them to play at the same time. Not Walmart fault as much as Apple

Perfect!,amber,5,2020-12-03,Love them! Got them at early Black Friday price. Very excited to finally get a pair as I had been wanting them for a long time. I use them everyday! I use them at work to ignore my coworkers and at home to ignore my children. Perfect in every setting.

Perfect for my needs!,Andra,5,2020-12-03,"Surprisingly comfortable and secure. Sound is good and no problems with mic sound when speaking.

"Nice, but overpriced",ranman66,4,2020-12-03,Works great with nice features. Overpriced as are all Apple products.
Why did I wait so long?!,Jamie,5,2020-12-03,"Built the exact same as earbuds, except better. The wireless feature is a game changer. Setup, and adjustments were a breeze."

CHECK THEM BEFORE YOU USE THEM,Cynthia,1,2020-12-02,"Pick up at store in Homewood IL ok but went to sync to my phone and says AJ airpods. Who is AJ? These suppose to be brand new, not refurbished. Returning, not using airpods stuck in someone else ears ughhh."

Good for larger ears w/ surrounding sound blocked,HonkyTonk,3,2020-12-02,"I had hoped to use them, but they are painful to ‚Äúcram‚Äù into my ears and then constantly fall out. I also don‚Äôt like the feeling of sound-blocking like being underwater. I guess I will look for a single-ear style headphone. My husband likes them though."

Exactly what I ordered,Cherie,5,2020-11-29,I haven't opened and tested because it's a Christmas present. I will say that I ordered 2 and both were in Walmart boxes and airpods were factory sealed. I was nervous purchasing because of reviews of getting used ones. I'm glad i ordered and sharing for anyone else having the same doubts.
Must buy!,Alyssa,5,2020-11-29,I use these so much! These work great and are worth the cost for the added features. I was so happy I got the best piece through Walmart.com!

1st time user,Tisha,5,2020-11-29,I love my iPods. If you are new to wearing them make sure to keep your charging case with you. The iPods will have to be charged if you plan on using them for an extended period of time.
Sounds great but...,Agomoljak,5,2020-11-29,"If I could say one bad thing about these is that it would be nice if you could locate just the case. My daughter lost her case and still had the ear buds, but there's no tracker in just the case itself so we never found it."
Amazing!,Lynette,4,2020-11-29,"I love these, it was totally worth the money. I use them to hear my favorite songs. They can last long times without charging wich is something I didn't have before. The only thing is sometimes they fall out of my ears, I am afraid that one day I might lose one. Overall this is a grate item."

,Roseann,5,2020-11-25,They fit perfect in my ears and also they are very comfortable to wear.....I am very pleased with them
So Disappointment,Jacqueline,1,2020-11-25,I REALLY CANT BELIEVE THIS EVEN HAPPENED TO ME THIS AIRPODS WHERE SUPPOSED TO BE A GIFT

,Johnny,3,2020-11-24,I have a question I bought a pair and I don‚Äôt know where the left side is acting up I try to re-restarted and everything but as soon as I put my right one on the left one audio stops on it you can‚Äôt hear anything how can you repair this issue what is there a way to exchange it ?
GET IT; It's worth it,Tahriel,5,2020-11-24,"Came in way way earlier than I expected which was super cool. And it opened, smelled, looked, connected and had the loud sound efficiency that I was looking for. THESE ARE NOT KNOCK-OFFS! these are seriously the real thing. Really worth your money."
Great Product,San,4,2020-11-23,Love Em.!!
Highly recommended!,Miranda,5,2020-11-23,"I love these! They are definitely easier/more convenient as an iPhone user, but still good otherwise. I use them all the time! I can go just about the whole week without charging them too! Great deal! Also, they shipped fast. Very happy and would highly recommend this product to others!"
Review on product name only,C,4,2020-11-23,I like Apple products. I bought this item as a Christmas gift on a Black Friday sale for my daughter. She has not had the opportunity to use them so I can only rate this product on history of Apple products. A more thorough review would be based on actual usage.
,jasmine,4,2020-11-23,AirPods battery life is short

Overall great product.,jasbir,5,2020-11-23,AirPods are good with one exception that they tend to fall. Got to be optional hooks or fittings associated with them in case somebody wants to use them.
AirPods Are The Best,Jay,5,2020-11-22,The AirPods work great and connect so easily. Earlier this year I purchased a knock-off brand of what ‚Äúlooked‚Äù like AirPods. The performance was atrocious! In comparison thus far I have never had garbled output or dropped bluetooth connectivity.
Delivery wasn‚Äôt what I was expecting,adriana,2,2020-11-22,"AirPods were left on top of another item, not in a bag or box. Someone could have easily taken them if no one was home. Thankfully, I was home when it was delivered!"

Stopped Working!,Skylar,1,2020-11-22,Right ear bud stopped working soon after purchase.
Amazing Purchase,Bee,5,2020-11-22,"One of my favorite electronic purchases. These AirPods exceed my expectations and are so convenient and easy to use. The sound is perfect, much like the wired version."
Amazing AirPods,Steph,5,2020-11-21,"I ordered in store pick up. They were new, never opened and they are amazing! I love mine. They automatically linked themselves as my name AirPods. Worth buying and will be buying more for the family"
Pods for today,Diane,5,2020-11-21,"Great quality sound, good for music, meetings, and studies. Not meant for workouts as pods would fall out with rigorous exercise"
Sound is poor,Justice,2,2020-11-21,My first pair of Airpods were pretty loud on a low volume setting. These ones are really low. The sound is just not good at all
Why Not,Kelly,5,2020-11-21,"I‚Äôm retired but when they went on sale I thought, why not. I‚Äôve used them more than I thought I would and it‚Äôs so easy."
Great price,AOL,4,2020-11-21,Very pleased. Sound quality is good.
Best ones Available for sound Quality!,,5,2020-11-21,Exactly what I was looking for. Excellent sound quality!! The comfort it has in the ear is perfect! No wires!!!
Would not recommend,Lisseth,1,2020-11-20,"Barley got it and it started messing up , I only had them for two days and they stopped working."
Great airpods for virtual piano & kendo lessons,Happy Mom,5,2020-11-20,It‚Äôs great. My son uses it for his Virtual piano & Kendo class. It is easy and no wires to restrict his movements. The sound quality is great.
,ladaysha,4,2020-11-20,Im only rating it 4 stars because it got lost the first time I ordered it but they work pretty good
Kinda new IPhone user,HappiestWhenShopping,5,2020-11-20,"Received on the day that I was as given, in a sealed box, they were brand new and the quality is great, they are definitely light weight and the price was worth it!"
Love them,Brooke,5,2020-11-20,"Well at first I was like go I really need these but my other wireless headphones stoped charging. So I decided to buy these while they were on sale because that was the only way I was going to get air pods. And Im glad I bought them because I found that they stay charged longer and don't take long to charge at all. I absolutely love these , I wish I could have gotten the newer ones but I didn't have the money. In all I will give them five stars. Oh and they automatically connect which thats awesome!"
,mssnipes,5,2020-11-20,Thank you so much for getting my replacement airpods to me so efficiently. My daughter greatly appreciated it! We to go the second time around!!!
HIGHLY RECOMMEND for APPLE USERS!,CAKEFACEBRIT,5,2020-11-20,"Love my air pods so much!! I am so happy to have a pair of headphones that has great quality sound, Bluetooth, and the charge holds longer than a couple hours! I like to use one ear piece at a time so that one can always stay charged while the other is being used! Plus it gives me an ear to be able to hear what is going on around me! These headphones which technically are ear pods or air pods are a great option for those who like to talk hands free on the phone and for those who like to listen to music without having a cord hanging down. I highly recommend these because they are a high quality pair of AirPods from Apple, at a reasonable price, and will last you a long time. I really appreciate the fact that the case can charge the AirPods themself so that your basically getting a backup for long days when you arent around a charger or an outlet ! These can be very easy to lose so I wouldnt recommend them for young kids or teens unless you buy these things they carry for AirPods that have a cord to hook onto each end of the AirPod so they dont get lost while they are out of their charging pod. Overall, these are awesome and every one who owns and Apple device needs a pair of these!"

Love these!!,KayBay8,5,2020-11-19,I bought knock off ones until I knew I wouldn't loose them lol and then the Black Friday Sale happened so I said why not. I love everything about them and compared to the knock off ones they stay in my ear without having to constantly readjust them.

Very satisfied with this purchase. Would buy again,Vickie,5,2020-11-17,Very Nice! I would definitely purchase another one. Looking forward to Christmas shopping. Wondering if this would be on a Black Friday sale to get another set for my grandchild who is a teenager and would love it. The price is good right now but just wondering. I had bought a cheap pair in the past that did not work but I trust Apple Products.

,Hi,5,2020-11-17,Great price and very good quality
,Rick,1,2020-11-16,I asked for it to be done as a gift with a special note on it. Very disappointed! I just received the AirPods alone.
Mom shopper,ERICA,1,2020-11-16,I bought them as gifts for my boys. So I dont know the quality yet. I dont do apple my self So will have to wait and ask them after christmas.
,Amanda,5,2020-11-16,"They are great, I have a multi-generational home and I can watch TV in my man cave without disturbing anyone. Win, Win"
Best audio ever!,Roxana,5,2020-11-16,I recently bought my AirPods for Black Friday and I could not be happier! Compared to Apple‚Äôs prices online I couldn‚Äôt have gotten a better deal.
Great price,Mary,5,2020-11-16,"Walmart has the best price anywhere on these. I have been using a no name Bluetooth headset as I didn't want to pay $100. However, these are worth it. Very light and comfortable. Automatically connect to your phone whenever you open the case or lift them up. I can leave my phone in one place and walk around the house, still connected."

Finally hit the mark with iPods!,Karin,5,2020-11-16,Consistent and comfortable is most important. Tried a few others but but the bullet when a Walmart had these on sale for Black Friday!
Not the latest model!,Greg,1,2020-11-16,"I ordered these hoping they would be 2nd generation because it advertises latest model, but when they arrived they are not 2nd generation."

Good price for a good product,Abdul,5,2020-11-16,I wanted to buy the AirPods as a gift for my mom and I found them at an incredible price from Walmart. The AirPods are excellent.
,Brittany,5,2020-11-16,"I absolutely love these airpods. Never wanted them until they were on sale for $99 for the holiday deals sale. Worth the purchase! Almost did not buy due to reviews on them falling out of their ears but they don‚Äôt fall out of mine at all. It varies so the only way you know is to try them out yourself. However, if it is a problem, I did google the option to buy cover pieces that go on the airpods from Amazon for more of a fit. Love how I can be listening to my music while cleaning and not be near my phone. No issues with sound, no issues with bluetooth connection. So far so good. Definitely recommend!"
Perfect!,BMH3,5,2020-11-16,"Love these, great price! I use them to listen to audio books and podcasts at work and music when I workout, its perfect for everything I've needed them for."

Misleading,Jose,2,2020-11-15,"Walmart got me! It said (Latest Model) ,but they are the first gen AirPods without the wireless charging. I could return them but I plan on using them for construction work so its not such a big deal."
,Trevor,5,2020-11-15,Cant believe how well they stay in your ear. There are times I even forget its there until Siri reads me a text that comes in
,EILEEN,5,2020-11-15,Received them 2 days earlier than expected! Sound quality is amazing and they don‚Äôt fall out while running. Pairs seamlessly with my iPhone and MacBook Air.
Apple Air pods great item. Great price.,Tiffanie,5,2020-11-15,I like the durability of this item. Also the fact that it goes with the phone so well. The price wasnt half bad either.
Love my new AirPods!,Rebecca,5,2020-11-15,"I got these last week while they were on sale for $99, and it was so worth it! They connect really easily with all my devices, even my Samsung phone, and the sound/mic quality on them is amazing! Glad I got them when I did :)"

,EILEEN,5,2020-11-15,Received them 2 days earlier than expected! Sound quality is amazing and they don‚Äôt fall out while running. Pairs seamlessly with my iPhone and MacBook Air.
Great wireless earphones,Beth,5,2020-11-15,I was skeptical about buying these as apple headphones generally hurt my ears. Glad I took the chance as I really think they changed them for the better
Must have for iPhones,mom37890,5,2020-11-15,"We received them within a week, which was before the expected delivery date. The kids grab and connect the airpods themselves. No cons. They love them."
Sound Quality FABULOUS but Fit is Poor,justina,3,2020-11-15,Purchased for my husband and they constantly fall out of his ears. Very time consuming and inconvenience with AirPods not fitting inside the ear with no grip to stay put. Returning due to this issue. Sound quality is FABULOUS!!!

Keep falling out,,3,2020-11-15,"works well except that airpods keep falling out off my ears. not good fit. i asked around and found about 20% of people around me having this issue. so vast majority should be good with the fit, but not for those with some kinds of inner ear shapes."

Great Buy.,My2princess,4,2020-11-15,Great buy. My only complaint is that I wish the battery life was longer.
Love them.,genara,5,2020-11-15,I love these so far. Im afraid Ill lose one because they are so small but sound quality is great keeps a charge for a long time love how music stops when I take one out. These are replacing faulty power beats 3. Love these better.

Wonderful!,Gene,5,2020-11-15,"I never thought I would need a pair of these, but my wife uses them at work to answer business calls, listen to audio books while working, and bible teachings; when I'm driving and call her she answers the phone by lightly touching the pod (she uses one at a time, and switches when one battery gets low) and her voice is so clear that I didn't realize she was using it. Before I bought my own, we went biking and she gave me one of hers and she kept one and we listened to a story while riding, and when we stopped for a walking trail she got ahead of me and we were almost 100 ft. apart before the signal to my pod faded out (she was carrying the phone). I have been most impressed with these and 'Siri' responds to my commands to start music, make calls, etc."
Great price,Cenisario,5,2020-11-15,I got these for Black Friday and the price I got them for was very good. The AirPods are great for calling and for listening to music.

Delivery Problem,valorie,4,2020-11-14,Air pods them selves were in great quality. The only reason I am giving a 4 out 5 stars is because they kept changing when they were going to be delivered and when they were delivered the package was just throw in my driveway and was behind my vehicle. Luckily I read my email that they were delivered and has gone out and found them. Otherwise they would have been ran over.
So happy I got it!,Mary,5,2020-11-14,"I got one for my for my husband, and one for myself. I love it, so easy to charge and use. Is very comfortable in my ear. Great price."
Excellent!!!!,Linda,1,2020-11-14,I love my iPods. Works perfectly. I am well pleased. Five stars by me.

Not a good experience.,Lainie,2,2020-11-14,The left ear bud doesn't work. Spent a long time on phone with Apple. Very annoying. I've never received a defective Apple product. I can't help but wonder if it wasn't a refurbished item.
Exactly what I ordered,Sarah,4,2020-11-14,"The AirPods arrived in great shape. Theyre exactly what I ordered, although it did take much longer than expected to arrive. They were a few days late, but I assume that had something to do with COVID? Overall pretty happy with the purchase."
,Rolonda,4,2020-11-14,"Everything works fine, they were brand new in the box. It came with the charger as well. Although the shipping took longer than the expected delivery date."
Love my pods!,Julie,5,2020-11-14,These are the best! Excellent listening and hearing. I have a little trouble with 1 of my ears but thats with all of them. They don't fall out and are very easy to manage. I am also older
Deals for Days 2020,Nataya,5,2020-11-13,I brought these as a Christmas gift for my wife but as soon as she seen them she just had to have them! I also thought that it was nice that Wal-Mart had them hand delivered to our house. I was worried that someone would steal them so that great as well.
"Not the ""Latest Model""",ChefMom,3,2020-11-13,"The heading is misleading. This is not the ""(Latest Model)"" The latest model Airpods have a wireless charging case. This one does not. It's chargeable by cable only. But other than that misleading lie, the Airpods work great."

Works with a droid,Deneen,5,2020-11-13,I was always under the impression that these airpods could only be used with Apple devices but I recently found out that they work just as well with Androids.
,Calvin,1,2020-11-12,The AirPods weren‚Äôt even in the box
"So far, so good, so...Well you get the rest.",Edward,4,2020-11-12,"So I read a lot of reviews on the used and missing AirPod orders that arrived to costumers that purchased them. Fortunately for me and mines.. My order was brand new, in original box with the clear tight plastic wrap all around the Apple box with a water tight seal. You all may have bought from a THIRD PARTY seller. I would be upset myself. Always look for the items condition and make sure it says BRAND NEW and who it says its shipped and sold by.Now... My thoughts on the device. Apple phone owners!. The settings on the pods are default and should connect automatically..Just be sure to leave the pods in the case and the case lid OPEN while pairing. Just hold the case over your Apple phone, follow the directions, and youre in.Dble tppng them out of the box while listening to music will only shuffle music forward. You can modify your dble taps to SIRI, play/pause, next track, previous track, and off in your PHONE SETTINGS when paired.The sound is great just like the classic wired airpod headphone.The battery life at 100% and playing music about half volume AND LESS for about 2 hours and its at 72% Calls are clear. No huh!? EHH!?? Or the other person saying you sound like you're in a tin can. No probs like that w these pods. I just wish you could control the volume by touching the pods but you cant.Its a raise the volume on your phone type deal. Other than that, thats my only quirk about these pods . Oh... And for $99 you cant beat that w a stick. I am pleased. Hope some of you find this useful as I tried my best to describe these pods. Thank you and have a nice day. BANG BANG!!"
,Joel,5,2020-11-12,"It came great, and they are new and got them for my b-day......Also great sound."
Horrible delivery method,Jennifer,5,2020-11-11,I have no issue with my purchase- but leaving 2 sets of Apple AirPods in an open Walmart bag in my front door step is bizarre!!!

Unhappy with Package item was delivered in,Angela,3,2020-11-11,"Pleased with the product. Not pleased with how the product was packaged and delivered. It came in a clear plastic bag and a label with my name on it. The packaging would have been fine if I was picking it up at the store. Luckily, my daughter was home when the package arrived as you could clearly see what the item was (Apple AirPods). Anyone could have walked up to our door and taken them. They should have come in a non-descriptive package."
,Eryn,5,2020-11-11,"Was told that it was deleivered at my porch so I went crazy looking for it and calling but other than that theyre great and I highly recommend , they were actually in my mailbox ."

AirPods Purchase,David Darling,4,2020-11-11,"They don't hold their charge as long as I thought they would. Maybe 3 or 4 hours tops. I work alone and a lot of the time I like listening to music while I work but I also move around a lot and it‚Äôs nice to have the wireless, but I have to stop midway through my work to charge the AirPods because they are about to die.. Having said that, they charge extremely fast. Like full charge after 20 to 30 mins maybe less. Good product. I‚Äôm satisfied with the purchase."
Amazing service,Shar,5,2020-11-10,Just as described. Love that I was given a picture of where my package was and a phone call letting me know it was delivered. Made online buying a little less stressful

Great price,,5,2020-11-10,These are on my wish lists for 2 Angel Tree teens. Cannot beat the price and delivery is amazingly fast. Thank you Walmart!!
Very odd shipment way,AJ,3,2020-11-10,"I am not very happy that this didn‚Äôt ship in a box! It was put on my doorstep by whomever in a opened Walmart sack! I don‚Äôt get why it was done that war. Then, they took a picture of it. It has NEVER been done that way! I wasn‚Äôt too happy about that!"
great for the price,Todd,4,2020-11-10,"Only reason I say 4 instead of 5 stars is these don't have spacial audio like the pro version. They still sound great and I have never had a problem with them falling out. I use them on my iMac and my iPhone SE. I swap back and forth with ease. Use Siri commands to pause, play, adjust volume, etc. Walmart has excellent protection plans at very reasonable prices and I almost always purchase one when buying electronics. If you purchase a protection plan make sure you call SquareTrade and register your product so they can save your receipt in their data base."
,Ty,1,2020-11-10,The AirPods are amazing and theres no damage. The driver however left them on the door and did not knock or ring the doorbell. People do steal packages and I would appreciate a knock.
,schollmommy,4,2020-11-10,"Item itself was great, not happy that it came in a plastic Walmart bag and not in a box as it is a Christmas gift for my son. Thankfully I was home and saw them delivering it, if not the surprise would have been spoiled. If not sending in a box, please notify customer ahead!!"

Don't regret buying this at all,Enoch,5,2020-11-10,"Was able to pick it up a day early, and it is very simple to use! Connected to my phone in seconds. Beautiful product, if you're considering it, go for it!"
,Nicole,1,2020-11-10,I didnt like that it was left on the porch not even a box. Also now my husband now knows what he got for Christmas! Thanks a lot Walmart!!!!
Highly recommended! Awesome sound,Nancy,5,2020-11-10,"Amazing, immersive sound. I'm really impressed by how easy these were to set up. They connected immediately to my MacBook after I turned on Bluetooth. I've only used these for about 15 minutes, but I'm pretty sure I won't be going back to my headphones anytime soon. They fit comfortably, too. They also shipped super fast from Walmart (I didn't pay for expedited shipping), so it was a nice surprise to get them a day early! Finally, I got these during the Black Friday sale, so I got a great price, but I would probably recommend them even at the regular price considering the quality and ease-of-use."

Very disappointed in delivery packaging,Deno,1,2020-11-09,Received my package in literally a plastic Walmart bag. With so many knockoffs out there I have to wait until Christmas for the person I got these for to open them to make sure they arent so many knockoffs out there I have to wait until Christmas for the person I got these for to open them to make sure they arent knockoffs now. Wont order from Walmart anymore.
,Ariel,5,2020-11-09,Received them 2 days early! A great purchase
,Queen,1,2020-11-09,Too muffled my cheap headphones are louder and more clear
AirPods are good but...,Saja,3,2020-11-09,The AirPods themself are great but the packaging was terrible it didnt come in any box it came only in the AirPods box. I wasn't informed when it was delivered. It could have been stolen or damaged.
The Best,4me1,4,2020-11-09,"ALL I Can Say Is These Are So Good, Easy To Lose If Not Careful When Using Them but awesome Product"
"Horrible, horrible packaging.",Amanda,1,2020-11-09,"I recently ordered Apple Airpods for my husband as a Christmas gift. I was excited because they were at an affordable price. Money is tight right now as I had to leave my job due to Covid. The package was delivered in a clear, see through, plastic bag. I am livid because my husband was able to see the gift without even opening the package. Someone could have stolen the package. I don't understand why you would deliver apple airpods in a clear bag? I'm incredibly angry"
,Mikayla,3,2020-11-08,"It was in a plastic bag, anyone could have easily stole these...."
keeps disconnecting,Dunia,1,2020-11-08,"Airpods keep disconnecting whenever I walk 2 or 3 feet away. I'm still in my house, just walking into a different room. my first set of airpods never did this. very disappointed with the product."
,Mikayla,3,2020-11-08,"It was in a plastic bag, anyone could have easily stole these...."
Best second generation AirPods,Rashard,5,2020-11-07,They came with the AirPods box and a extra charger the sound quality is the best and it‚Äôs not a scam of money it‚Äôs worth your cash so go buy it now now it‚Äôs the second generation AirPods
Good quality!  Very satisfied!,JULIE,4,2020-11-06,Have enjoyed listening to my music. Have definitely been settling with previous ear pods.

Amazing,Brad,5,2020-10-31,"Apple AirPods are amazing. I have tried different ear buds, both wireless and wired. Apple AirPods are the best if you have an iPhone. I bought a pair for my daughter‚Äôs birthday gift. Walmart had them in stock and make pickup very easy! If you‚Äôre waiting, don‚Äôt! Buy them now!"
Great!,Monica,5,2020-10-29,I bought these for my granddaughter and she lives them!
Airpods are pretty nice,Ted,5,2020-10-29,My 13 year old son loves them. I feel they are a bit pricey but Apple has a good product on their hands with the airpods!

Don't work with some audio applications .,Craig,3,2020-10-28,"It's very hard to get the earbuds out of the magnetic case. However, the main issue is that they don't work with our audio recording software (Protools, at 96Khz sample rate), which is the main reason for the purchase. They do work with iTunes and sound good, but often take a while to connect."
2nd gen AirPods,,5,2020-10-27,Bought these to replace 1st gen AirPods that had terrible battery life after 3 years. Very happy with the new ones. Volume can go considerably louder than the 1st gen ones. So nice to have AirPods with decent battery life again.

Happy customer,Letta,5,2020-10-25,I like the design the fit and the sound. I really like everything about this product. I am happy with my purchase.
Comfortable with good sound,TampaKaren,5,2020-10-25,I had hesitated to buy these because of the price. I finally caved and bought them and now I wish I'd bought them earlier. They are extremely stable in my ears and they work really far away from the iPad... like from the end of the house. It's so nice to set a playlist and wander around without carrying a device. I also like they work with just one airbud (leave one in the case).
Perfection!,Evelyn,5,2020-10-25,They arrived a few days later than they said they were supposed to but the AirPods were and are perfection!

Great quality,anan,5,2020-10-24,"I am not a techie.. But I wonder why these airpods does not provide ability to some important functions, such as increase/decrease volume, mute/unmute. My bose wireless sound sport has volume control functionality, but these airpods are way better and would not pick up surrounding sound like my Bose.. Anyways, whatever offered have been advertised clearly with airpods.. Quality is unbeatable so Thumbs up!"

Air pods- LOVE THEM but they hurt my ears so bad!,10ac10,5,2020-10-22,They hurt my ears so bad but i love them So much!!
Should have done it sooner!,Treva,5,2020-10-22,They are definitely worth the money!
Worth the buy,Eduardo,4,2020-10-21,I really like this product compared to the AirPods Pro since the Pro tend to slide down your ear after a while of use. The sound quality is great as is the mic quality.
,Dominga,3,2020-10-20,"I cant really review these two pair of ear pods, They are Christmas gifts. I guess they will let me know once they open them up"

Apple Airpods,April,5,2020-10-15,I love my airpods. They come in handy with everything I do. Only downfall is they do get a bit dirty. Other than that everything totally fine. Cleaning them is not hard at all.

Good,Brinkz,3,2020-10-14,Never had a problem with them good price
,KmilleF,5,2020-10-12,I bought this for a friend and she loves them. I bought these instead of the wireless case because another friend said the wireless charging was slow compared to the cable. I don't know from experience.
Replacement,Ashley,5,2020-10-12,"I have had my previous ones for years and the battery life started getting shorter so I bought new ones. My husband has the newest ones and I dislike them, so ordered these exact ones again! Works great!"
Great product with a minor occasional  issue.,Gail,4,2020-10-11,For the most part I love them for the convenience!! They are also comfortable. The sound is very clear. The only downside Is that people have told me that they cant hear me when Im wearing mine during portions of my calls. I'll be talking and the call will be going fine then for some reason they can't hear me.
Buyer Beware,BILL,1,2020-10-10,I ordered these air pods from Walmart assuming they were new. What I received were AirPods registered to Princess Ne Ne which included her ear wax. I took the purchase to Walmart but the store would not honor my return because Walmart.com had used a third party vendor. This is an agregious case of buyer beware.
Great Apple product,Corey,4,2020-10-08,Last 5 hrs of listening to music before i have to charge for half hr to an hr then back to charged. Needing a longer battery life is my only complaint so far.
Great product,EDWIN,5,2020-10-08,Its a good product in total but sometimes its uncomfortable for me but not all the times. It doesnt falls when Im doing exercise which is a good thing
CHARGER DOESNT WORK,Anika,1,2020-10-08,THE CHARGER DOES NOT WORK!!! IT WONT CHARGE UP MORE THAN 5% AND THEN DIES QUICKLY!!! MY AIRPODS HAVE BEEN SITTING AROUND UNUSED FOR WEEKS NOW!! VERY DISAPPOINTING!!!

Fit issues,DrK8,3,2020-10-05,"Not thrilled with this purchase. These don't fit in my ears really well. If I press them in, they fit better, but the whole idea is to be hands-free, right? I purchased some silicone covers with gripping ""handles"" that perch uncomfortably in my ears to keep these in."
,RedheadTiff,5,2020-10-03,"Very easy to use/set up. Sound is ok. Music starts/stops automatically when you take them out, which is nice."

,Sheri,2,2020-10-01,After just a couple of months use the right earpod won‚Äôt work properly. Can put in left ear and barely hear out of it. Nothing when put it in my right ear.
Great pair of AirPods,Steve,5,2020-10-01,Apple AirPods Fit comfortably in my ear they dont fall out has a deep rich sound I use them as much as possible. Two way communication on the Apple AirPods very crisp clear sound and works great for speak to text
okay but i still like them,Gomeza02,5,2020-09-28,"not as loud as i would like but overall good, I also do not like that they fall out when ever they want, when i listen to youtube vids and other vids its kinda not too loud but for music it is great!!! i kinda would have preferred to get the wrap around headphones that are more affordable."
came next day!,Alex,5,2020-09-28,Came fast and there loud. Love it
,DT,4,2020-09-24,Nice product and great quality but it hurts my ears.
,Rupali,4,2020-09-24,"I had to exchange the ones initially received due to left ear AirPod connectivity issue, but the one that I recently received is working great. I do want you to please validate my purchase date on Apple's website as I went to check the serial number and it said purchase date not validated. Otherwise great customer care service received and it was easy exchange."

Only if they last,Michael,3,2020-09-16,Well we will see how long this pair lasts. They are the replacement for the previous pair after one side died on me.
Horrible Product,Veronica,1,2020-09-15,Horrible product! Save yourself money and don't purchase these. I bought a pair and already am having problems with them glitching! Buy straight from apple instead not Wal-Mart.
So glad I bought these,Brittany,5,2020-09-14,Absolutely love my apple airpods. I debated for so long on whether or not I wanted to take the dive and spend the money. But I am SO glad that I did! I use these every day. It‚Äôs great when I‚Äôm up and cleaning. The battery life on them is amazing. And I love the tap to answer calls.

,Allen,4,2020-09-07,Easy to set up; great connectivity (much better than cheap ear buds with connections that cut out); wish I understood that they did not come with silicone covers like the Pros-would have gotten the Pros.
,SAMANTHA,5,2020-09-03,I love the fact that as soon as oli took it out the case connected automatically to my phone. It is very comfortable in my ear and long battery life.
my review,laura,1,2020-08-27,you can get that cheaper at 5 below right next to sport's academy for $4.00.
,Jenni,5,2020-08-26,"The price point had me hesitant with this purchase, but I was tired of being trapped by wires. They were always in the way when cleaning, walking... I was constantly popping my earbuds out on accident. So I caved in and ordered a pair of AirPods and I couldn't be any happier. They have become a staple in my daily life. I use them to listen to music when I clean and walk, answer calls when I'm shopping, and listen to relaxing rain storm tracks to fall asleep peacefully. The charge lasts enough that I only charge them once every few days (typically 3; 2 if I've heavily used them). And if one of my kids wants to hear what I'm listening to, or talk to their dad on the phone with me, I can put an AirPod in their ear and they're happy to join the conversation. These have been one of the best things I could have purchased during this quarantine."
Not comfortable,Ms sassy25,2,2020-08-25,The charge does not hold long. The product not comfortable in the ear falls.
"Good for College Students, and Anyone Else at Home",Alexis,5,2020-08-25,"Solid investment for now being a full-time student online. I can run around the house cooking, and doing schoolwork no problem--the blue tooth range is far enough to cover the whole space of my house so I can leave my phone in one spot and walk around freely."

Smart Decision,Janie,5,2020-08-21,"In this age of Zoom meetings, my need for some sort of device to enhance my hearing was absolutely necessary! I am a senior citizen and I wasn't sure about what to get but since I have an iPhone and felt the airbuds would be more compatible, I ordered these. I am extremely pleased with the comfort when using and the sound quality!"
Expensive worthless pieces of crap.,farmhouselady,1,2020-08-19,"POS. No range even in next room where none of my other bt devices have any trouble. Constantly disconnects, big rigmarole reconnecting. Unbelievable. I cant believe these ever sold. Had to call Apple to get them working the first time. All I got was noise"
,Andrea,3,2020-08-16,"After 2 months, one airpod stopped working."
Air pods,Marie,5,2020-08-16,This is a good and very reasonable price. I love the features. Very convenient
So glad I got these!,Debbie,5,2020-08-16,Works great! I like you can use on two or three devices without having to make sure one or the other is not connected.
90% satisfied,HMC425,4,2020-08-16,"I really like them, be cause they feel comfortable in my ears while working out. but after a year of using them, one of the AirPods started to have trouble with connecting. Also, I am not very careful and I keep dropping the case. You definitely need a case protector."
Amazing product,Julio,5,2020-08-14,To be honest one of the best purchase it fits comfortably for all sizes I use it on a daily basis and for work smart purchase
Enjoying,GB,4,2020-08-13,I am enjoying these headphones
Very pleased,Gail,5,2020-08-13,"I am very happy with them. I use them for online conversation with work, for music and for movies and videos. They stay in my ears. The sound quality is excellent. They are lightweight in my ears, which is very important for my physical comfort level. The price was much lower than buying them from Apple."
Impressive,,4,2020-08-12,"I was really skeptical about getting what are essentially wireless earbuds, but I honestly think these are worth it for the hassle-free concept. My husband had a pair that I tested before getting my own and I was impressed with how innovative they were."
I‚ÄôM WIRE FREE!,ED,5,2020-08-11,"I have wired earbuds that I plug into my phone to listen to music while I do yard work. Sometimes I accidentally yank on the wire and either it comes unplugged from phone or it comes out of my ear. Either way, I have to be careful so I don‚Äôt hurt my phone or myself. Now that I have the Apple Wireless AirPods, I don‚Äôt have to worry about all that, and I don‚Äôt have to have pockets in order to have my phone on me. I can just put the phone down on a table where I am outside while I work and still listen to my music. Love these! Sound is great too. Oh and I‚Äôm usually doing yard work a good couple hours and longer and they stay charged with maybe 30-35% power used."

AirPods are great but only one problem,Nelida,5,2020-08-10,First of all the product great and I really love them but the only down side about them is that when Im listening to music and get on an app the AirPods start to disconnect with a very lagging sound but other than that their great.
Question,Victoria,3,2020-08-10,Are these actually apple airpods ?
Not happy,Meme,2,2020-08-10,AirPods slip out of my ear. Second day my left ear AirPod sounded like it went out. The battery life is not so good. Will be returning
"Apple AirPods 2nd gen, great quality!",Tris,5,2020-08-10,"hey yall sorry for the lowercase aesthetic but i got the apple airpods 2nd gen's for my 14th birthday. they have great sound quality, lots of bass (for earbuds), and they're obviously easy to keep in your pocket when you go in the store, or anything else ofc. on iOS, there are many settings you can choose for each airpod (ex. double tap left to go to the previous track, double tap right to go to the next one, or double tap for siri.) but yeah that's my review ig. have a great day and good luck with your future airpods! :)"
Apple AirPods,Larry,5,2020-08-10,Excellent to wear around as they have great sound. As long as you aren't jumping around they will stay in place. They can fall out of your ear when you bend over to pick things up if you move too quickly.
PLEASE DOUBLE CHECK,Josue,1,2020-08-10,Please please double check your stuff once you receive it. I am truly angey with myself because i ordered these airpods. Picked then uo and when i looked in at the box it was all scratches up but i thought nothing of it. I sent them to puerto rico because it was a gift. Once my cousin opened the airpods.. turns out the airpods were used.. had dirt... were broken...had scratches. I didnt open them bexause it was a gift. But that was my biggest mistake. Some customer must have switched them out and returned their old ones. I am surpirsed how people can just do this. Not im out 140 dollars... please guys.. make sure everything is all good
Apple AirPods,Larry,5,2020-08-10,Excellent to wear around as they have great sound. As long as you aren't jumping around they will stay in place. They can fall out of your ear when you bend over to pick things up if you move too quickly.
For being Apple product I expect better quality,,1,2020-08-07,"Something is wrong, I cant hear very well.. the sound is very low snd the people on the other end say they cant hear me well and that it sounds like Im in a tunnel.."
Great sound,Helene,4,2020-08-02,I am very happy with my purchase. I really didn‚Äôt want to spend a lot for headphones. But the ones I had before would keep falling out of my ears. This a great investment.
Softer Ear Tips,Vanita,5,2020-08-01,My granddaughter loves these Airpods. The ear tips could have been made softer for the price paid for them. Good quality sound.

DONT BUY THEM,Lynzy,1,2020-07-30,at first they were working pretty well then all of a sudden the left ear just stopped working im so mad.
Great!,Michelle,4,2020-07-28,These are my first pair of AirPods! They work well! I just wish they didn't fall out my ears so much but its okay my ears a small so maybe thats why. Lol but I like them!
"Best Product, AirPods 2 :)",James,5,2020-07-27,"Love these puppies! I use them with my 2018 Ipad, Iphone7 plus, LCD TV by downloading the Roku app and tapping on head phones through the app! Also use them with my laptop and 2 desktop bluetooth computers:) Yes you can buy something cheaper, but if you want a good dependable pair with great mics, I wouldn't fool around!"

Love these! Worth your money!,Mackenzie,5,2020-07-24,Great price! I use them all the time because I have the X where you can not use ear buds without another part.

Awesome,Kery,5,2020-07-24,"Ive bought a few cheaper wireless headphones and theres nothing like the original ones, just charge them and turn on your Bluetooth and thats pretty much it. Good quality sound and the battery is very good for what I use them."
Excellet But n important Issue,Cody,4,2020-07-20,Excellent in terms of music. Apple alone the name is having worth. Only issue is batterylife. You don't want to keep charging in few hours. Other than that all things are working great.
Perfect Pods,Not Prince,5,2020-07-20,Pairing these with my iPhone is the easiest pairing I've ever experienced. They feel comfortable & substantial & not at all inexpensive.

Battery life concern,Tricia,3,2020-07-19,The product is functional. However the battery life is not long. I validated 8am start at 98% by 11am at was at 7%. Once I dropped them in the case which was at 100% they charged instantly. Im not sure thes may be refurbished. This is my second pair. First order had to return. This technology is essential for me and work.. not sure whats going on but will monitor.
Great so far!,Naf3,4,2020-07-16,"This was a gift to my daughter and she loves them she hasn't complained about anything yet, she's only had them for a few weeks now . I'll update you in the future on how the wear and tear is."
soso,Markqueisha,3,2020-07-16,when i received these my right airpod was defective.
Bad airpods,Keaxia,1,2020-07-14,"After about 3 weeks of having them, the right AirPod has gone out and I cant hear anything"

Pleasantly surprised!,La Folie Fran√ßaise,5,2020-07-11,I had been skeptical of the sound quality but my students kept telling me that I needed to get these so I did. (I‚Äôm a big fan of Bose headphones.) These guys sound great! I‚Äôm still trying to get the hang of touching the left one for some controls and the right one for others. I like that the music stops when you remove one of the AirPods. I‚Äôm just afraid of losing them out of my ears as they don‚Äôt fit my ear quite right.

Great product but has fault of having having both,Tina,4,2020-07-03,These have very quality sound and connection and your txts get read to while having earbuds in very convenient. But I dont like the fact that if you take one out they dont work anymore you have to have both in all the time!

Whats not to love about a solid Apple Product?,Melissa,4,2020-06-23,Everyone has one! Keep track of the warranty. We had a bad ear bud within 30 days
Good item for bad delivery,hayat,1,2020-06-23,"The material is good but the delivery was bad ,it let me order two times and even consider report to police bcs of lost item but they brought it after two day of sending me email that it been delivered"
,Sara,3,2020-06-22,"They broke already, only one ear bud working"
"Not Durable, unsuitable for run-in, bicycling",Jordan,1,2020-06-21,"I bought two sets of Airpods, one for myself and one for my girlfriend. They each lasted about 2-years and then went bad. Not water/sweat resistant. Not a secure fit in your ears. OK if you are just sitting around, inactive, but easy to dislodge if you are doing any thing active. They will fallout if you are running, biking, etc. Overall, not a good value in my opinion. I replaced with mine with Jaybird Vista's. Much better value. Waterproof, secure fit for active use and sound better too."

,Tiera,1,2020-06-20,SOMEBODY STOLE MI STUFF FROM OUTSIDE MY DOOOOOOR I NEED TO REPLACE THEM
,Rebekah,5,2020-06-20,I absolutely love my AirPods. The case stays charged for days (even weeks if I‚Äôm using them less frequenly) and is small enough to carry around with me everywhere. They‚Äôre super easy to clean and they sound great.
,Darillinn,2,2020-06-19,They keep falling out my ear
non charging airpod case,Jimora,1,2020-06-17,airpod case doesn‚Äôt charge .
They are great if they fit your ears,Regina,4,2020-06-16,"I‚Äôm one of those unfortunate people who just can‚Äôt fit apple ear buds in their ears. Even the old corded ones didn‚Äôt stay in long. I love these, they are so intuitive with my iPhone and MacBook and iWatch. I had to buy some cheap silicone adapters to help keep them in. I wonder if the AirPods Pro would be better for getting a custom fit in my ear, I didn‚Äôt want to spend that extra money tho."
Great pods,Ineedsleep,5,2020-06-15,Love the pods!!! Had lots of bass in them!!! Feels comfortable in my ears. I have no problem hearing with them in and my caller can hear me back!!
Great wireless ear phones,ReviewAtron,5,2020-06-15,Great and easy to use. Ordering and delivery was seamless and the simplicity combined with quality explains why even people who are not part of the Apple ecosystem prefer these to the competition.
Works great,Melis,5,2020-06-14,Helps in the car especially since the new law to be hand free. Help in the hour can do things without holding my phone

Average,patricia,3,2020-05-16,"Sound is good. Easily comes off ;therefore, easy to lose or misplace."
weak charge,terry,3,2020-05-14,"I used these to listen to books on tape, they worked ok for that. they are horrible for music. really wears you down listening to music with them. worst part is after a year the case wont take a charge anymore and I really didn't use them a ton. for 200 dollars I expect a lot more. I personally think apple is living off the name and not making quality products anymore.. ill try something different this time."

Small defect,KarlysMom,3,2020-05-12,I bought these for my niece and she was so excited. She said the sound quality is great. They hold a charge for a long time and it's nice to have the charging case when you need it on the go. The o ly problem is the left one keeps cutting in and out randomly.

Great product!,Tabitha,5,2020-05-07,Bought these for my teen girls. Best gift ever! We had purchased a cheaper brand for around $50 and they didn't last 2 months. Apple is always a Great product! Trust me It‚Äôs worth the extra money!

Nice airpods!!,Lisette,5,2020-04-29,The airpods are really cool nice to do alot of active things with and not a single drop out of your ear. Another cool thing about them is that they are easy to connect to your phone once you open them up it already syncs in with your phone and with your personalized name love the hands on free change mode ans pausing when you remove them.

So comfortable I use them all day now.,Jami,5,2020-04-24,I can‚Äôt live without my EarPods when I walk and workout. I even forget I‚Äôm wearing them after I‚Äôm done they are so comfortable.
Outstanding,Kurtj59,5,2020-04-21,"These AirPods are easy to use, offer great sound and charge right in the case. I didn‚Äôt know any ear bud could be so comfortable and functional at the same time."

Cheap,Norma,1,2020-04-15,I bought these for my son and 7 months later the right AirPod stopped working very disappointed.
Great,Yvette,1,2020-04-15,Don‚Äôt order this is not good it says Laster‚Äôs version and you get the very first not good
Love these!,Kristie,5,2020-04-15,"Love these! Wear them on the treadmill and either listen to music or watch a show while walking / running. They stay in well , sound quality is great and I love how when you take on out of your ear it pauses your show or music!"
Do not waste your money. Broke in 3 months.,Isfa,1,2020-04-14,"I purchased these Black Friday 2019. Today, they stopped pairing with all phones by saying ""not your airpods"". When it does pair with my iPhone or other iPhones, only the right airpod works. I only use these average 2-3 hours a day at the maximum. I actually even only opened these on New Years Day. I have only been using these for 3 months and look at this ridiculousness. WALMART YOU NEED TO INCLUDE SERIAL NUMBERS ON YOUR RECEIPTS AND SEND PAPER RECEIPTS IN SHIPMENTS. I contacted Apple on the phone and they said they could do nothing because Walmart did not include the serial number of them on any of my online recipes. I did not receive a paper receipt of it with the shipment so I am out of luck. DO NOT WAST YOUR TIME AND MONEY. Airpods are useless and will break in 3 months no matter how careful you are. Buy a cheap brand that will break in 3 months anyways."
They are good quality,Jalawna,5,2020-04-13,I had no issues with these . I ended up losing one and then my case a couple months later but while I had them I loved them.

No label might as well go knock off brand,Dontdoit,2,2020-04-13,So when you buy an apple product for the price I did for air pods you would expect them to say apple on them or at least have the logo but they don‚Äôt it‚Äôs frustrating that they were so expensive but still look like the knock off pair
Cool bit of new tech!,Marco,5,2020-04-12,Decent ear buds compatible especially great for tech that no longer has the headphones jack. The container and headphones are small so the only down side is it is easier to lose them then traditional wired headphones. Very good sound quality and noise cancellation.

Instructions hard to read,db538,3,2020-04-07,confusing to set up and the little amount of instructions they include has the print so light that it is really hard to see. The sound is good. I'm still trying to figure out how they work for different things.

My teen loves them!,Candice,5,2020-03-11,"I bought these for my teenage daughter and she loves them! They can packaged nicely and pre charged! They were easy to set up and are easy to use. She loves how easy it is to change songs and answer calls. The battery life is great, she uses them all the time and has never had an issue with them lasting all day on a charge."
Dont waste your money,TW,1,2020-03-10,These airpods are good just like the off brand. BUT you spend 3 times the amoutn and apple had no way of tracking them - so when they are gone- they√¢¬Ä¬ôre gone! Stick the off brands. They are just as good!
Great but sometimes staticy,Marcel,4,2020-03-09,These are really great and have a long distance range from the phone without getting static. Sometimes it gets static like but I just re pair with my phone and it‚Äôs fine. Great purchase!
,Courtney,1,2020-03-05,I bought a pair of airods from walmat in marrero and three days later went back to get an exchange they told me they could NOT take them back the one for the right ear is broken it dont keep charge
,Alicia,1,2020-03-04,"Ordered these black friday 2019, never got to use them because they came defective. After trying for hours, realized they wouldn√¢¬Ä¬ôt let me connect to my phone because the case wasn√¢¬Ä¬ôt reading the right airpod. Then after sending them in for a replacment pair, they said I would have to cancel the order"
,Caty,1,2020-03-04,THIS IS NOT THE LATEST MODEL. THE LATEST MODEL√¢¬Ä¬ôS STATUS GREEN LIGHT IS IN THE FRONT OF THE COVER. THE FIRST GENERATION√¢¬Ä¬ôS STATUS GREEN LIGHT IS INSIDE THE CASE.

AirPods are my preferred headphones.,DanJ,5,2020-02-25,"Expensive, but they‚Äôve always worked very well. I lost mine and ran right out to get another pair the very next day before finding the old ones under the car seat last week. I guess that shows you how much I like them."

They Are Just OK,Chip,3,2020-02-13,"They are ok but I am a little dissapointed. The sound quality is good but not stellar with little bass. They are also cumbersome to connect having to go into settings on ios devices and a little bit easier on MAC OS. You would think with all of that work tgey put into the nice battery status alert that pops up when you open the charging case, they would have a connect button to spare you some of the navigation. A Siri command would be nice too."
So comfortable you don‚Äôt even know they‚Äôre in!,Myron,4,2020-02-11,These earbuds are very convenient and the wireless application is so much better than the earbuds that are non wireless. At times you almost don‚Äôt know they are even in your ears. You will need to be careful because their so comfortable there could be a time when one of the Budd comes out of your ear and you wouldn‚Äôt even know so be cognizant of check both ears at times.
Happy,Andrea,4,2020-02-11,"Great, easy to use, but also easy to lose. My son lost one of them already."
,Elana,4,2020-02-05,i love these airpods the only thing when they send them you have to be there to sign for them. Other than that these airpods are really great.

Not the latest model,Jessica,1,2020-01-25,"I order this since I have little time to go at the store to purchase them. It says latest model that is airpods 2 and receive the first airpods. You need to change your description from latest to older model. They work properly, but it wasnt what I expected and order."
LOVE'EM,MsTukes,5,2020-01-24,I sooo love this airpods. I bought them for my daughter and son but now I need to order me a pair because I can't keep my hands off theirs.
Great experience even with android.,Jacob,5,2020-01-21,"Good sound quality, even though I have an android phone. Just can't use touch feature, but that's to be expected. Have had these for 2 weeks and are great!! Definitely worth the money."
Like,nakhia,4,2020-01-16,Love it!!! You can play music with your friends also while listening yourself!! One thing I did not like was that it isn‚Äôt as loud as the regular headphones but they are pretty loud
Same thing,Keykey,1,2020-01-14,"I still got the first generation instead of the second generation, which it said when I bought them the latest model which is the current version."

Great!,Lila,4,2019-12-27,These work amazing except the battery life could be longer.
,Sg,1,2019-12-26,The AirPods overheated after few minutes of use. Walmart count not exchange it. Waste of time!
√¢¬ö¬†√Ø¬∏¬èBuyer Beware√¢¬ö¬†√Ø¬∏¬è,REALLY,1,2019-12-26,The reason I am giving this such a LOW rating is because the advertisement is incorrect! This was bought as a gift for 2019 Christmas turns out not the latest model. (Air Pod Pro) as of 12/25/19 is the latest model. Imagine how dissapointed she was on Christmas morning and that was all they wanted. Imagine how I felt watching that happiness turn into shock and dissapointment. Walmart has had several problems with there online advertisement. This was something very personal to me and my daughter. I didn√¢¬Ä¬ôt know the difference in the Air Pods just that the advertisement says latest model. I√¢¬Ä¬ôm sure the product is very nice it√¢¬Ä¬ôs Apple but the company needs work.
Pods,AshAsh,3,2019-12-22,They have pretty good battery life. When it comes to answering and hanging up the phone that doesn‚Äôt work and I‚Äôm not to happy about that. Also when checking battery life on phone that sometimes doesn‚Äôt work.
Apple AirPods,Michael,4,2019-12-20,"Very nice ear buds. The sound is good but not great. Listening to music, I have better ear buds but none stay in my ear as well while working out or while practicing golf. Usually all other ear buds fall out or are uncomfortable. These are the best and the sound quality is good. The batter life is good and comfort while in my ear is better than most. I have another pair that are better but those cost twice as much. For the money, these are worth it. I do wish I spent the extra and purchased the Pro‚Äôs though."

I like em!,Jenn,5,2019-12-17,"Surprised at how long they last without needing to be charged. The airpods themselves last a day/day and a half for me because I don‚Äôt extensively use them. That being said, the case could probably last around 3 to 4 days for me. Sound quality is pretty good too and they get pretty loud. The touch feature can get a little tricky though. Sometimes, I‚Äôll tap on an AirPod to skip a song and it won‚Äôt work. I also noticed that the case itself tends to collect a lot of dust easily."
,Reindeer,4,2019-12-15,I haven‚Äôt opened it yet because it‚Äôs a Christmas present for my daughter.
It works okay.,,4,2019-12-14,"I have never owed apple air pods before, but from the reviews, I thought it would be the next best thing for me. I think, though, it is just okay. I would say the sound quality is better than the less expensive one. However, if you owe an android, do not buy. They have features for I phones only. And, when you turn them off, and turn on again, the volumes goes very loud. I am not sure if this happens if this is an android phone I am using it with or what not. So, maybe great for I-phones, but not so great for android phones."
as described,Kthorn,4,2019-12-13,order has a gift for Christmas so they have not been used yet.
,Mt3g,3,2019-12-12,Can‚Äôt rate as the ones I kept are Christmas gifts and I returned the other pair.
Easy to connect to your device.,rmotheroftwo,3,2019-12-12,"Fits same as the wired apple head set. Sound is good. Down side is you can‚Äôt adjust volume from the ear buds, you have to do it from your device. It has a double tap feature but I have found I have to tap a little hard for that to work so I just end up taking them out to pause or use my device to skip a track when listening to music. The charging case is small which is nice. Pairing was really easy."
Defective,KakashisWife,2,2019-12-11,"I just got these today. They are defective after using them for an hour. Straight out the box they were perfect, but now an hour later the right airpod is not working, and the left one is extremely staticy and goes in and out. Im taking them back."

Worst experience,Sow,1,2019-12-04,"The tap technology doesnt work, I have horrible distortion in the music when I try to use the airpods. This is just a horrible experience. I wonder if walmart sells out refurbished ones in the name of new pairs"
,K,3,2019-11-29,I received these put it didnt come with a block for the wall ..
The future of earphones,jay848evo,5,2019-11-28,One of the best ever products from apple. Great price during Thanksgiving. I was one of those folks who thought wearing airpods is weird. But they are extremely useful for someone who take a lot of calls or even listens to music on the move. Not the greatest in terms od music quality dor audiophiles but a 5/5 for usability and utility.
Was not satisfied with next day delivery at all,Cwaldkirch,4,2019-11-25,"As it stands now as part of my overall grocery order, so far I am satisfied with the ear pods being included..still remains to be seen quality of ear pods as they are to be a Christmas present"

Where are the wires?,RequiredNames,1,2019-11-11,"I was browsing on Walmart for wired headphones and I came around this item here. I saw that it costed $150+ and thought to myself that this might be some premium quality headphones/earbuds. So I purchased it like any person would, right? The package arrived and I was excited. When I opened it, I was greeted with the front of the box showing the ""Airpods"". I opened the box, embraced the satisfaction from the box, and I saw the charging case. I opened the charging case only to see that my product DID NOT include the wires. I was furious and gave him to my son which he was happy about. For the people browsing this product, DO NOT BUY IT! These are the WORST earbuds I have ever purchased. I know this sounds like an exaggeration, but please. DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT!. 0/10, would never buy again."
DOES NOT WORK WITH ANDRIOD (not clickbait),Dylan,1,2019-10-31,These Apple Airpods with Charging Case do not work with an andriod. I bought these and got them in my mail. I tried for the longest time to connect these to my andriod. Please consider this before getting these.

Need replacement,Devon,1,2019-10-16,One of them is louder then the other
A few issues but all in all a good set of ear buds,,4,2019-10-09,Maybe offer different colors. The white seems to get dirty very easily and they are extremely hard to get clean. If you scrub them to hard to remove the finish. Only other thing is I wish that you could connect to more than 1 device at a time. They are not good for loud atmospheres. Other than that they are a great set of headphones and the microphone works great.
Check the product details,ELISON,4,2019-10-08,Great product but no plug. Makes no sense to sell something without a plug to charge the Airpods.
I love it,Carol,3,2019-09-27,AirPod

Birthday wonderland!!!,Lele,5,2019-09-18,I bought these for my son's birthday. He loves them. He hardly takes them out when he isn't in school. He allowed me to test them and I must say the sound quality is really good.

"nice for the first few months, then conks out",carol,1,2019-09-09,"delivered april 30, 2019. Worked until August 20. Less than 4 months. They were always stored in the case when not in use.

I do not feel good about buying a product that is so expensive and conks out in so short a period of time."

Overall I give a lot 10/10!
AirPods,ArdaI,5,2019-08-06,"AirPods are the greatest thing since sliced bread. I cannot imagine life with out them. Hands free, no fussy wires, my phone can stay in my purse. Makes life so much easier in NYC."

Charging problem.,Cecilia St Brice,1,2019-07-31,It doesn‚Äôt hold the charge for very long. I charged both the the AirPod in the case overnight and o wasn‚Äôt on the AirPods for an hour when one at a time they both went dead.

Not what I was looking for.,Chris67,2,2019-07-11,They didn‚Äôt work for me. I was using them primarily as a Bluetooth headset for talking on the phone. The mic wasn‚Äôt of the quality I needed. Friends said I sounded like I was in a box. The battery life wasn‚Äôt as good as I would like also. I‚Äôm sure if they are used for music they would be great.
Mike‚Äôs Pods,MichaelPlus9,4,2019-07-11,"Easy to use and work great, only issues that I‚Äôm a big buy and if I run they fall out need something to hold support them staying in ear"
Great product,Ben M Jr,5,2019-07-11,I absolutely love my AirPods. Long listening time and quick charge for the headphones and for the case. Seamlessly switches from my iPhone to my iPad.
A dud,SHACK,2,2019-07-10,Bought this for fathers day gift... one airpod isn't working already
Great!!!,Concernedshopper,5,2019-07-07,"Bought these for an iPhone user as a gift. The battery life is awesome. They don't fall out. The volume is great. What not to like said the iphone user!!! ""I'm rich now, no wires."" Lol. She loves them and I would say, apple has done it again. All the airpods are selling for the same price. What made me choose Walley World the shipping and fast delivery. No shipping fee and next day or two day delivery. I cannot remember. That was the deal breaker for me."
stopped working after a week,Jackie C,1,2019-07-07,They worked fine for one week then the right ear stopped working - sent back!
Like it but,Wilbur,2,2019-07-07,About this a month ago I really like it but the light doesn't come on anymore and I don't have the box or the receipt to return it sometimes it's a little fuzzy and staticy between the Bluetooth better than that I'm glad I made the purchase

Apple Does It Again,tthew2you,5,2019-07-03,"Everything we have come to expect from Apple. High Quality, ease of use, excellent sound, and nice charging case that keeps the pods going even when not plugged into a power source."
Seamless application,Grams,5,2019-07-03,"I bought these for my grandsons and they LOVE them. Worked right out of the box, sound great and travel nicely."
Great,Rakel,4,2019-07-03,I love it
AirPods,,5,2019-07-02,"They are very light weight, durable, and easy to handle. The box charges the AirPods twice before having to be recharged. My teen daughter loves them!"

Perfect,Casca7,5,2019-06-30,"These are wonderful. A lot of inaccuracies from some reviewers here. NO, these don‚Äôt only work with iPhones. They work fine with other phones as a regular Bluetooth connection. Of course you‚Äôll lose Siri and the ability to tap to advance or tap to pause, but that's for iPhones. 45 minutes before they run out??? You bought a fake pair or damaged or defective. Use these for almost 3 hours at a time daily without them coming close to running out. Stick them in the already charged or charging case and they‚Äôll charge back to 100% quickly. As far as the case ‚Äòdropping easily‚Äô, that‚Äôs called ‚Äògravity‚Äô. Yes, the case is slick, but at the gym and at most places, the case stays in the car. Only the air pods come with me. PLUS, order a silicone case for the case. It‚Äôs cheap and sticky to the hand. Found at BB, if you can figure out what store that is."

Rare defective unit or junk?√∞¬ü¬§¬∑√¢¬Ä¬ç√¢¬ô¬Ç√Ø¬∏¬è,,2,2019-06-25,"Sound is great, if they work. One of the units broke right away (defective left ear). Disappointment to me just like Beats. Apple charges preimum rates for averge to sub par products. Maybe this was a freak defective unit. Maybe they are all junk. Returning ours though to be safe"
Love them!,Sharon,5,2019-06-24,I bought a pair for the husband for Father‚Äôs Day because I love them so much! Definitely great when blocking out noise or working out!
Perfect!,Margaret,5,2019-06-23,I couldn‚Äôt find one pair of the Apple AirPods in any of our local stores for my husbands birthday so I looked on line. Sams club offered them at a great price and shipped them in time for his birthday. My husband loves the comfort of the ear buds and the sound quality is excellent! I‚Äôm looking to get a pair for myself!

Disappointed was expecting better,Jen,3,2019-06-19,Must be close to the phone or signal goes in and out. Doesn‚Äôt always pause when removed from ear like it‚Äôs suppose to. My aftershocks stay connected and at much greater distance from phone. I was disappointed in those I was expected so much better from apple.
Great Airpods,Harry,5,2019-06-18,"These AirPods have a remarkable sound and are very light weight and stay in your ear, they are very comfortable. I have recommended these to everyone I know and so far 3 other people have bought them"

Disappointing,GEpp,1,2019-06-13,"Bought these a few days ago and the right earbud battery lasts about 45 minutes fully charged. Ive tried all the fixes. I reset them, I drained them all the way down and recharged, etc. Didnt work. Now I guess I get to hassle with exchanging or getting a refund. Blah."
Best price!!,Zumba,5,2019-06-12,I searched the price every where Sam‚Äôs has cheapest prices. My son really enjoy them. Thanks Sam‚Äôs club!
I don‚Äôt leave home without them!!!,Sy,5,2019-06-12,This is my second pair! I recently lost one of them at a large event and I couldn‚Äôt manage three days without them!
Great Present!,Satisfied Consumer,5,2019-06-12,"Purchased the airpods for my daughter's 19th birthday. Although she has an Android phone, this pairs and works great! She previously had some high-end blue tooth earbuds but wanted to give these a try - she is very happy with this present! We thought to purchase the wireless charging but for the money, this was the better purchase. We'll wait until more advances/ changes are made to make that leap in purchase, for now - these are perfect!"

"They work, but shipped presentation left some on the table",Jason O,3,2019-05-20,Shouldn't be shipped in a mailer. Needs to be packed in an actual box to ensure the integrity of the package.
Amazing Airpods,OurAmazingChild,5,2019-05-16,We purchased these for my Son;'s 14th birthday and he loves them. Fits well in his ears and the sound quality is amazing. He highly recommends them.
Don't buy if you have Android.,Disappointed,1,2019-05-15,"Waste of money for ME unfortunately. I'm an Android user. However I have read that it isn't a problem using these with with the Android system. I knew I would lose some basic functionality by not having an iPhone, but I didn't expect the HORRIBLE connection issues I experienced. They constantly cut out for multiple seconds at a time, then they'd try to make up for lost time by speeding up the song to catch up (I didn't know headphones could do that). Then the audio would bounce back and forth between right and left, and crackle like crazy . Really weird stuff. It sucks though because when they work right, the audio quality is incredible. They're better than any ear bud wired or not. I'm going to be returning these which breaks my heart. Cause they really are THAT good despite their shortcomings. If you have an Android I would just stay away."
Walmart airpods are a scam,disappointed,1,2019-05-10,"The first time I bought these, the sound was low quality and airy. When I went to exchange them, they worked fine for about a month, then they wouldn‚Äôt show up on my screen when I opened the case, and the left airpod doesn‚Äôt charge or work at all."

Second pair are perfect!,AOlson,5,2019-04-19,"These have great sound. Great range from the phone. Great battery life. ‚ÄúHey Siri‚Äù is awesome. Phone calls are perfect. Connectivity great. My first pair were lemons with bad connectivity and hey Siri didn‚Äôt usually work, but second perfect. So, if you have any problems, return for a new pair."
,Holyfrijole88,4,2019-04-17,Very convenient size and battery life. Take them just about anywhere without worrying about wires tangling around in your pocket. Only reason for withholding a star is the sound quality. Although probably still better than some earbuds I still find myself wishing for more.
Amazing but.....,Clipze,3,2019-04-12,"Loved these when I got them and I would give a 5 star review as these are amazing. Fast sync, good sound and fit same as the normal Apple headphones in my ears which I loved. But the reason for the 3 star is that in under a week the left AirPod stopped charging. Cleaned up everything and still wouldn‚Äôt charge. Took them back and got my money back and ordered another pair. Yes technically they are fixing the issue but in the mean time I am without music at my work while I have to wait on the new ones. Otherwise these would deserve 5 stars. Well that is assuming that the next pair don‚Äôt have the same charging issue. But I have researched online that you HAVE to use the Apple charger that comes with these or else that issue can occur. I have a different charger that I use for my iPhone that I was using which I won‚Äôt use on them next time. Not sure If that video was a fake and that some of the AirPods are just defective or not, but I‚Äôm not willing to take a risk on another pair."
Great,Sunshine,4,2019-04-10,The Airpods are great but the package was a bit destroyed and dirty but anyway they are great and they are functioning.
,Cmkloos,4,2019-04-10,Good product. Rated at a 4 because I feel like I need it turned up more to hear it.

"Improved battery life,crystal clear audio",RabbiAppleDiciple,4,2019-04-08,"The sound quality is the same as the old one(very crystal clear), but the battery life is much longer. Beware the airpods are amazing but only if you have an ""Apple Air"" if it doesnt fit, it doesnt fit. There is zero sound blocking, but i see it as an advantage especially if you're using it 4 phone calls."

Airpods 2,oe,5,2019-04-07,"Exactly what it says it is. Airpods 2 but with the charging case. If you buy these expecting the wireless charging case that is your mistake. I recieved everything I expected from this purchase, I received my airpods 2 and they worked just as I pictured."

They sound great, battery life is good, and they lair instantly."
